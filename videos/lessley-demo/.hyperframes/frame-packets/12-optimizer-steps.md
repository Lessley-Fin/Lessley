# transcript-scroll-artifact-reveal — Transcript-Scroll Artifact Reveal

**intent**: The frame travels vertically along ONE long content surface — an agent transcript, a running task feed, an analysis document, a story draft — rendered full-bleed on a flat canvas (no device frame, no held mockup), by camera pan or element scroll; the traversal itself is the story ("look how much work happened / how much is here"), until ONE focal interaction — a file-chip click, a quote highlight, a collapsible-row expand — pivots the shot into an artifact/detail reveal: the deliverable behind the work.

**roles served**

- Key_Feature (modes: `pan-to-workspace` · `feed-rush` · `document-to-artifact` · `selection-pivot`): the x-viral AI-product grammar for "the agent did a lot of work → here's the deliverable." The long surface is the EVIDENCE (tool pills, checked progress items, task rows, headings, comps tables, story paragraphs), read at traversal pace; the artifact is the PAYOFF (full workspace with live mockup, spreadsheet with highlighted cells, inline ask-panel, sub-task stack). Reach for it when the feature's proof is the volume/depth of generated work and the beat should cash that in on one interaction — not a held device tour (`device-surface-showcase`), not a cursor-chased workflow (`cursor-ui-demo`).

**duration**: 5–11.8s (feed-rush 5.4s · pan-to-workspace 5.0s · selection-pivot 9.3s · document-to-artifact 11.75s)

**shot structure** One `[long content surface: agent chat transcript / task feed / analysis document / story doc]` sits full-bleed on a `[flat light canvas]` (goldens: warm off-white / cream / beige / plain white — the surface's own background IS the scene background); dark text with small `[accent]` marks (green verb highlights, model-tag pills, check circles, yellow cells). Three acts: TRAVERSE → HINGE → ARTIFACT. Camera discipline is the signature: at most TWO real camera moves in the whole shot, bracketing the hinge; everything else is element motion on a static frame.

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~40–60% of runtime) — establish + vertical traversal (the evidence).** The surface establishes with one small opener — a `[title]` types on / a centered `[title]` shrinks ~50% and glides to the top-left to dock as a fixed header / the frame opens tight on the `[chat panel]` — then the traversal begins: the frame travels DOWN the content (or the content streams UP through the frame), revealing progressive work in reading order: `[prompt → tool pills → checked progress items → typed summary]`, `[tagged task rows → muted tasks → checklist block]`, `[heading → paragraph → comps table → bullets]`, `[title → story paragraphs → dialogue]`. New rows may cascade in (staggered arrival) before the scroll takes over; a typed line may finish under the moving frame. Traversal texture varies by member: one continuous slow pan, a fast continuous feed rush, stepped scrolls decelerating at each stop (speed-blur between stops, content fading at frame edges), or one smooth scroll easing to a stop.
- **Scene 2 (~1–2s) — the hinge: ONE focal interaction.** The traversal settles and a single interaction pivots the shot: a `[file-attachment chip]` spring-pops in below a typed handoff line and a cursor glides in and CLICKS it; a `[sentence/quote]` gets a selection-highlight sweep and a `[tooltip pill]` spring-pops above it for the click; a `[collapsible row]` reaches the frame center and EXPANDS; or the typed `[verifier summary]` completes as the implicit trigger. This is the only interaction in the shot — the cursor (if any) appears here for the first time.
- **Scene 3 (rest) — artifact reveal + hold.** The hinge cashes in, choosing ONE reveal mechanic: a fast smoothly-DECELERATING zoom-OUT re-frames the whole `[workspace]` (the panel just traversed becomes a sidebar beside a `[live mockup]` and `[tool panel]`); an `[artifact window: spreadsheet]` scales up from small toward full frame, then a slow push-in + lateral pan settles on its `[highlighted cells]`; an `[inline panel]` expands below the highlighted line and a `[follow-up question]` types into it; or the row unfolds into a `[sub-task stack]` and the scroll settles on `[narration text]`. Optional coda: one cursor click instantly swaps a `[screen]` inside the revealed artifact (e.g. a phone tab click). Frame locks; element motion only to the end.

- Variant — _pan-to-workspace_ (001_claudeai, 5.0s): traversal is a REAL camera pan — opens tight on the chat panel, one single uninterrupted downward glide (never cutting away) over pills → checked list → typing verifier summary; hinge is the summary completing; reveal is ONE rapid decelerating zoom-out to the three-part workspace (chat-as-sidebar / phone mockup / tweaks panel); coda cursor click swaps the phone screen instantly. Exactly two camera moves total.
- Variant — _feed-rush_ (010_perplexity A, 5.4s): NO camera at all — title docks to header, five tagged rows cascade in, then a fast continuous upward ELEMENT scroll races through muted tasks and a checklist to a collapsible row; hinge is the row itself; reveal is the row expanding into a six-item sub-task stack, settling on narration. Cursorless.
- Variant — _document-to-artifact_ (010_perplexity B, 11.75s): traversal is a stepped ELEMENT scroll (static frame) — the document climbs in fast steps, decelerating at each stop, blur/fade between stops, clearing to blank canvas; hinge is a typed handoff line + file-chip pop + cursor click; reveal is the spreadsheet window scaling up then one slow continuous push-in + rightward pan onto the yellow-highlighted forecast columns.
- Variant — _selection-pivot_ (014_OpenAI, 9.3s): typed headline → document builds (bubble prompt + typed title + populating paragraphs) → one smooth upward element scroll eases to a stop; hinge is the selection-highlight sweep + the shot's ONE push-in framing the sentence + tooltip-pill click; reveal is the inline panel expanding below the line with the referenced quote and a rapidly-typed follow-up question. Camera locked at the pushed-in zoom to the end.

**motion vocabulary** continuous slow downward camera pan; fast continuous upward feed scroll; stepped document scroll decelerating at each stop; smooth scroll easing to a stop; speed-blur between scroll stops; content fade at frame edges; centered title shrinks ~50% and glides to a top-left header dock; task rows cascade in staggered; typed line / typed title / typed follow-up question (caret); green leading-verb highlights and model-tag pills riding past; checked-item strikethroughs riding past; file-attachment chip spring pop-in; tooltip pill spring pop; chat-bubble arrival; cursor glide-in + click; selection-highlight sweep across a sentence; ONE camera push-in onto the selection; fast decelerating zoom-out to the full workspace; artifact window scales up from small; slow push-in + lateral pan settling on highlighted cells; collapsible row expands into a sub-task stack; inline panel expands below the line; phone-screen instant swap on a coda tab click; frame-lock hold.

**rule mapping**

- vertical traversal by ELEMENT scroll — fast feed rush / stepped document scroll / smooth scroll-to-stop → `3d-page-scroll` (flat variant: tilt ≈ 0 — the surface's content `translateY`-scrolls to sections; the multi-phase scroll variant covers stepped stops; keep ONE ease family across all steps — `power3.out`/`power4.out` for UI-scroll feel)
- vertical traversal by CAMERA pan (transcript glide) → `viewport-change` (pan mode — the world translates up under a static frame; one continuous tween, no cuts)
- speed-blur between stepped-scroll stops → `motion-blur-streak` (blur peaks at max scroll velocity, resolves to 0 at each settle)
- which content each traversal beat reveals (stop-by-stop sequencing) → `dynamic-content-sequencing`
- centered title shrinks and glides to dock as a fixed header → `gsap-effects` (one simultaneous scale + translate tween; plain two-property move, no named rule required)
- task rows cascade in staggered before the scroll takes over → `waterfall-entry` (arrival cascade; goldens use fade + slide-up — the house rule prescribes binary-opacity whip-in, adopt the house form) or `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered group) for card-like rows
- typed lines — verifier summary, handoff line, document title, follow-up question, opening headline → `discrete-text-sequence` (+ `context-sensitive-cursor` for the trailing caret)
- file-attachment chip pop-in / tooltip pill pop / chat-bubble arrival → `spring-pop-entrance`
- cursor glides in, lands, clicks (hinge and coda) → `cursor-click-ripple` (+ `physics-press-reaction` to compress cursor and target together on the press)
- selection-highlight sweep across the sentence → `css-marker-patterns` (highlight sweep)
- ONE push-in onto the highlighted selection / slow push-in + lateral pan settling on highlighted cells → `coordinate-target-zoom` (measured off-center target — the lateral pan IS the counter-translate component), sequenced under `multi-phase-camera` when it follows the window scale-up
- fast decelerating zoom-OUT to the full workspace → `coordinate-target-zoom` (zoom-out variation: open at the zoomed-in framing, pull to scale 1 with `power3.out`/`power4.out`) or `viewport-change` (single continuous pull on the `cam` object)
- artifact window scales up from small toward full frame on the click → `spring-pop-entrance` (hero arrival scale-up; tune overshoot to ~0 / `power3.out` so the window reads weighty, not bouncy)
- collapsible row expands into a sub-task stack / inline panel expands below the highlighted line → `anchored-layout-expand` (in-flow accordion growth pushing subsequent content DOWN — never tween width/height) + `waterfall-entry` (or `spring-pop-entrance` stagger) on the arriving children
- phone-screen instant swap on the coda tab click → `discrete-text-sequence` (discrete whole-state swap; instant, no in-artifact camera move)
- green verb highlights, model-tag pills, check-circle strikethroughs, yellow forecast cells, edge fade masks → static styling of the surface content — no motion rule needed

**camera modifier**: The blueprint's camera law: **at most TWO real camera moves, bracketing the hinge** — the goldens are emphatic (their briefs carry CRITICAL camera notes). Pick the traversal mechanic first: camera pan (`viewport-change` pan — pan-to-workspace only) OR element scroll (`3d-page-scroll` flat — all others); never both at once. The reveal then spends the second (or only) move: one zoom-OUT to the workspace or one push-IN to the detail (`coordinate-target-zoom`, phases sequenced by `multi-phase-camera`), after which the frame LOCKS — all remaining motion is element-level (typing, expand, screen swap). The feed-rush variant spends zero camera moves: the whole shot is element scroll + expand. This restraint is what separates the shape from `cursor-ui-demo` (camera servos to every interaction) and from `device-surface-showcase` (a showcase camera presenting a held hero).

**Overflow (scrolled/panned surfaces — required for a clean `check`):** the traversal deliberately moves content past the frame edges. Clip at the scene (`overflow: hidden`) AND mark the moving inner layer (the `.page-content` / `.world` wrapper carrying the transcript/feed/document) with `data-layout-allow-overflow` — otherwise `check` reports `text_box_overflow` / `container_overflow` for every row that has scrolled off. The clip handles it visually; the attribute tells the layout audit it's intentional.

## Selected motion rule: anchored-layout-expand

---
name: anchored-layout-expand
description: Edge-pinned container grows (or collapses) along ONE axis and in-flow content reflows with it — a pill springs open downward into a dropdown, a panel grows a sub-task stack, an input card stretches as typed text wraps, a pane expands over a neighbor. Transform-only (mask + slide, or proxy-driven scaleY + counter-scale) because width/height tweens are forbidden; the push on subsequent content is a matched translate on the same tween.

# Anchored Layout Expand

> The law: **author the layout at its final (expanded) state in CSS, then fake the collapsed state with transforms.** The container never changes size — the _visible_ region does — and everything downstream rides a matched translate. The browser computes layout ONCE; every intermediate frame is pure transform.

THE one-axis growth primitive: a container pinned at one edge appears to grow along a single axis, and the in-flow content after it moves in perfect contact with the traveling edge — dropdown, sub-task stack, growing composer card, pane widening over a neighbor. Growth and push are ONE motion: if the panel's bottom edge and the pushed content ever separate or overlap, the illusion dies.

Distinct from [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (a free-floating two-shot morph with no neighbors to push — this rule's container is a live layout participant), [spring-pop-entrance.md](spring-pop-entrance.md) (arrival at a point, no edge travel or reflow), and [reactive-displacement.md](reactive-displacement.md) (displacement by a colliding intruder; here content moves because the container's edge reached it — layout causality, not collision).

## How It Works

1. **Mask** — a wrapper at the final body height (`BODY_H`), `overflow: hidden`. Never tweened.
2. **Sheet** — the panel surface + content inside the mask, starting at `y: -BODY_H` (tucked above the mask window, behind the pinned header).
3. **Below** — ONE wrapper holding everything after the container, also starting at `y: -BODY_H`.
4. **Grow** — ONE `fromTo` drives sheet AND below from `y: -BODY_H → 0`. Shared tween ⇒ the descending bottom edge and the pushed content stay in exact contact by construction. Collapse = the same pair tweened back.

When the surface must visibly **stretch in place** (rows revealed top-first, or a pane growing sideways), use the proxy counter-scale variant below instead.

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="stack">
  <div class="expander">
    <div class="expander-head">{headerLabel}</div>
    <div class="expand-mask" id="expand-mask" data-layout-allow-overflow>

        <div class="expand-row">{rowB}</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- EVERYTHING that must be pushed lives in this one wrapper -->
  <div class="below" id="below">{followingContent}</div>
</div>
```

```css
/* Layout is the EXPANDED end state — no collapsed geometry exists in CSS. */
.expander-head {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2; /* the sheet slides out from UNDER the header */
}
.expand-mask {
  height: BODY_H; /* authored final height — NEVER tweened */
  overflow: hidden;
}
.expand-sheet {
  height: BODY_H;
  border-radius: 0 0 SHEET_RADIUS SHEET_RADIUS; /* bottom-only — header + sheet read as one grown card */
  will-change: transform; /* + on .below */
}
```

```js
// BODY_H must equal the mask's CSS height exactly — measure once at build.
// (Montage caveat: per the contract, in a multi-scene master use an authored
// CSS-matched constant instead — later clips may not be laid out yet.)
const BODY_H = document.querySelector("#expand-mask").offsetHeight;

// The grow: ONE tween, BOTH sides of the seam.
tl.fromTo(
  ["#expand-sheet", "#below"],
  { y: -BODY_H },
  { y: 0, duration: GROW_DUR, ease: GROW_EASE },
  GROW_AT,
);

// Garnish: rows already ride the sheet; the fade stagger makes them read as "options arriving".
tl.fromTo(
  ".expand-row",
  { opacity: 0 },
  { opacity: 1, duration: ROW_FADE_DUR, stagger: ROW_STAGGER, ease: "power2.out" },
  GROW_AT + GROW_DUR * 0.25,
);

// Collapse — same machinery back; faster (closing is a snap decision).
tl.fromTo(
  ["#expand-sheet", "#below"],
  { y: 0 },
  { y: -BODY_H, duration: COLLAPSE_DUR, ease: "power3.in", immediateRender: false },
  COLLAPSE_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Proxy counter-scale — surface stretches in place** (rows revealed top-first holding their screen positions; the "payload card expands from the tool-call line"). Drive mask `scaleY` and the sheet's exact inverse from ONE proxy — two independent tweens are wrong: eased midpoints of `s` and `1/s` are not inverses and the content squashes mid-grow. Net content scale is `s × 1/s = 1` every frame; seek-safe because everything derives from the one interpolated proxy.

  ```js
  const grow = { h: COLLAPSED_H }; // 0 for fully collapsed
  tl.fromTo(
    grow,
    { h: COLLAPSED_H },
    {
      h: BODY_H,
      duration: GROW_DUR,
      ease: GROW_EASE,
      onUpdate: () => {
        const s = Math.max(grow.h / BODY_H, 0.0001); // clamp: no divide-by-zero
        gsap.set("#expand-mask", { scaleY: s, transformOrigin: "50% 0%" });
        gsap.set("#expand-sheet", { scaleY: 1 / s, transformOrigin: "50% 0%" });
        gsap.set("#below", { y: grow.h - BODY_H });
      },
    },
    GROW_AT,
  );
  ```

- **One-axis pane expand (X)**: same machinery rotated 90° — pin the left edge, sheet from `x: -PANE_W` (or proxy `scaleX` + counter-scale, origin `0% 50%`). Decide the neighbor's fate explicitly: **overlap** (pane paints over it, no neighbor tween) or **push** (neighbor rides the same tween). Never both.
- **Typed-wrap growth** — the composer card gets taller as typed text wraps. Quantize: one short step per wrap boundary, each moving the pair by one `LINE_H`; wrap times come from the deterministic typing schedule ([discrete-text-sequence.md](discrete-text-sequence.md)), never measured at render time. Two battle-tested traps:
  - **Composer cards have no pinned header** — a composer grows from its TOP edge (the send-button footer stays put), so a plain y-step clips the card's top out of the mask. Combine the proxy counter-scale with the wrap quantization (step the proxy by `LINE_H` at each wrap time) and split the surface into a **sheet** (carries the top radius) + **footer** (carries the bottom radius) so the growth seam stays invisible.
  - **Wrap TIME vs wrap POSITION are two different authorities** — the typing schedule decides _when_ a wrap fires, the browser's line-breaking decides _where_ text actually wraps, and with proportional fonts they silently disagree. Author an explicit `\n` in the typed string (with `white-space: pre-wrap`) at the chosen split point so both derive from the same authored fact.
- **Springy open** (rare, explicitly-playful): `back.out(1.2)` — the edge overshoots a few px; the pushed content bounces with the panel (correct — they're in contact). Default stays `power3.out`.
- **Row grows a sub-task stack**: the row is the pinned header, the stack is the sheet, every later row lives in `#below`; chain several scopes for progressive disclosure.
- **FLIP hand-off**: if the container also TRAVELS to a new layout slot while resizing (prompt promoted to heading, card docking into a sidebar), that's a FLIP problem — `/hyperframes-keyframes` (FLIP recipes). This rule stays the in-place one-axis specialist.

## Critical Constraints

- **NEVER tween `width` / `height` / `top` / `left` / `margin` / `padding`** — the mask's height is a CSS constant; only its children transform. Tweening the mask IS the forbidden move this rule replaces.
- **`data-layout-allow-overflow` on the mask** — the collapsed phase parks the sheet outside the mask's box by construction, which trips the `hyperframes check` layout gate (`container_overflow`). The flag is the sanctioned waiver: this overflow is the technique working as designed, not a bug.
- **Sheet + below share one tween (or one proxy)** — matched-but-separate tweens on the two sides of the contact edge are the classic seam bug.
- **Everything downstream rides `#below`** — content outside the wrapper is overlapped at t=0 and orphaned during the grow.
- **`overflow: hidden` on the mask** — without it the tucked sheet is visible above the header at t=0.
- **Counter-scale needs a proxy**, clamped `s ≥ 0.0001` (a fully-collapsed body divides by zero).
- **Deterministic sizes** — `BODY_H`, `LINE_H`, `WRAP_TIMES` are build-time constants or one-time measurements, never per-frame layout reads.

## Selected motion rule: coordinate-target-zoom

description: Zoom into a specific non-centered element by combining scale with counter-translation — target ends at viewport center after the zoom completes.

# Coordinate Target Zoom

A simple `scale > 1` on a wrapper pushes off-center content OFF the visible canvas. To zoom _into_ a specific non-centered element, apply scale AND an inverse translation in lockstep so the target lands at viewport center.

## How It Works

Two nested wrappers, separated concerns — never scale and translate on the SAME element (`translate * scale` ≠ `scale * translate` in CSS transform composition):

1. **Outer wrapper** applies `scale` (the zoom) around `transform-origin: 50% 50%`
2. **Inner wrapper** applies `translate(x, y)` (the counter-shift)

The counter-translate is the **negation** of the target's offset from viewport center:

```
T = -offset
```

Derivation: the inner translate moves the target to `offset + T` in pre-scale units; the outer scale S (around center) maps that to `S × (offset + T)`; landing at center means `S × (offset + T) = 0` → **`T = -offset`**. The formula does NOT depend on S — the translate is identical at 1.5×, 2×, or 3×. A common wrong intuition is `T = -offset × (S - 1)`: it coincidentally matches at S = 2 and is wrong at every other scale.

⚠️ **This is the NESTED-wrapper formula.** The single-wrapper camera in [viewport-change.md](viewport-change.md) puts `translate(x,y) scale(S)` on ONE element, where CSS applies scale first — there the counter-translate is **`T = -offset × S`**. The two formulas are not interchangeable; match the formula to the wrapper structure.

## Getting the offset

`T = -offset` is only as good as `offset`. The #1 way this pattern ships broken is hand-computing `offset` from a layout formula, getting the **sign** or magnitude wrong, and letting the zoom amplify a small error off-screen. **Default to measuring the target's real laid-out center; reserve the formula for symmetric rows.**

**Default — measure the actual center (works for ANY layout).** Immune to sign errors because it reads the rendered DOM, not a mental model:

```js
await document.fonts.ready; // metrics final; fallback fonts are 10–30px off → tens of px after a 3×+ zoom
const W = 1920,
  H = 1080;
const r = document.getElementById("target-card").getBoundingClientRect();
const TARGET_OFFSET_X = r.left + r.width / 2 - W / 2;
const TARGET_OFFSET_Y = r.top + r.height / 2 - H / 2;
```

Measure **once at setup** and bake — never per-frame in `onUpdate`. Because the measurement is async (`fonts.ready`), build and register the timeline inside the same `async` setup so the baked offset is ready before `window.__timelines[id]` is published.

**Shortcut — symmetric equal-width row ONLY:**

```js
const index_offset = targetIndex - (N - 1) / 2;
const TARGET_OFFSET_X = index_offset * (CARD_WIDTH + CARD_GAP);
```

⚠️ This assumes every sibling is the **same width**. The moment the row is asymmetric, it gives the wrong answer — often the wrong **sign**: the heavier side shifts the centered target the _opposite_ way you'd guess (e.g. `companion(220) + gap + wordmark + gap + chip(110)` puts the wordmark ~55px **right** of center, but "chip − companion" intuition says left). For anything but equal cards, **measure**.

**Headroom budget — cap the scale from the measured size.** A zoom multiplies any centering error; keep the target ≤ ~88% of the canvas at peak:

```js
const maxScale = Math.min((0.88 * W) / r.width, (0.88 * H) / r.height);
const ZOOM_SCALE = Math.min(DESIRED_SCALE, maxScale);
```

A target filling 97%+ of the frame reads as cut-off the instant its center is slightly off — and a hand-baked offset always is. (The perception gate flags this as `primary-offscreen`; `data-layout-allow-overflow` does **not** exempt it.)

// at setup (after fonts.ready), baked. Counter-translation = -offset.
const counterX = -TARGET_OFFSET_X;
const counterY = -TARGET_OFFSET_Y;

// Scale and counter-translate MUST share position, duration, AND ease —
// otherwise the target visibly wanders mid-zoom.

tl.to(
  "#zoom-inner",

- **Zoom out (target → wide view)**: reverse the phases — start zoomed-in, then tween to `scale: 1` + `x: 0, y: 0`; the "reveal" beat is the panorama.
- **Multi-target zoom sequence**: chain zooms (target A → pause → target B → pull back); each segment needs its own counter-translation pair.

## Values

| token      | range                                   | notes                                                                                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ZOOM_SCALE | 1.5× modest → 3× dominant → 5×+ extreme | cap via the headroom budget; raster media needs `sourceResolution ≥ rendered × ZOOM_SCALE` |
| ZOOM_DUR   | 1.0–2.0s                                | under 0.8s feels like a teleport, over 2.5s drags; both tweens share it                    |
| ZOOM_AT    | after the layout lands + 0.5–1.5s       | give the viewer time to scan the layout before the camera commits                          |
| DWELL      | ≥ 1.0s after the zoom settles           | 1.5–2s ideal — the viewer must be able to read the target (climax dwell)                   |

## Critical Constraints

- **Outer scales, inner translates** — never both transforms on one element; nested wrappers keep the math clean.
- **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on the outer wrapper** — non-center origin breaks the counter-translate derivation.
- **`overflow: hidden` on the scene root** — zoomed content leaks past the frame otherwise.
- **Scale and counter-translate share duration + ease** at the same timeline position, or the target drifts mid-zoom.
- **Offset measured once at setup** (after `fonts.ready`), baked — never recomputed per-frame, never hand-derived for a non-symmetric layout (wrong sign → target shoved off-frame).
- **Scale within the headroom budget** — target ≤ ~88% of the canvas at peak, derived from the measured size.
