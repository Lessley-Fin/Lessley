## Selected blueprint: overwhelm-surround

# overwhelm-surround — Overwhelm / Close-In

**intent**: Convey overwhelm by accumulation. Recognizable subjects assemble, density markers scatter in to amplify "look how much," then the central subject morphs into the viewer's own avatar and elements close in from ALL sides — the frame feels surrounded, not zoomed-into. The emotional arc is recognition → claustrophobia.

**roles served**

- Problem (from `problem-mockup-overwhelm`): when the problem beat must first show "too many tools / too much surface area" and then put **the viewer inside it** — a literal swap of subject (product → person) followed by a closing-in that feels invasive. Reach for it when the pain is "you're buried," not "this metric is bad" (that's `dataviz-countup`).
- Problem (from `desktop-clutter-accumulation`): when the overwhelm is a **workspace**, not a tool
  count — live windows, stickies, and alert toasts pile up until the frame is chaotically full, and
  the beat resolves not by closing in but by shoving the clutter aside and asking the question.
  Reach for this variant when the pain lands on words ("how can you X… when you spend months on
  Y?"), not on a surrounded avatar.

**duration**: 6–9s (clutter-shove-to-question variant ~10s)

**shot structure** (a `[bg]` canvas; recognizable surfaces first, the viewer's avatar revealed underneath, then a radial crowd)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~1.6s) — recognizable assembly.** Three `[product mockups / surfaces]` assemble into something the viewer knows — staggered scale-in, the **center** one full-size, the two flanks smaller (~0.86). Each rides a low-amplitude float so they feel like live context, not a static collage. Camera static.
- **Scene 2 (~1.6–3.0s) — density amplifies.** `[platform icons / logos]` scatter in around the mockups (staggered), used purely as **density markers** — "look how much surface area," not animated dials.
- **Scene 3 (~3.0–4.6s) — the morph (signature move).** The CENTER mockup MORPHS: its content fades out, the container reshapes, and the viewer's `[avatar]` is revealed **underneath** — a literal swap of subject, product → person.
- **Scene 4 (~4.6–end) — close-in.** `[task bubbles / demands]` close in from ALL sides toward the avatar (radial staggered entry). The avatar **stays put** while the bubbles invade — the claustrophobia comes from being surrounded, never from a camera push. Holds on the crowded state.
- **Variant — clutter-shove-to-question** (replaces Scenes 3–4 and
  inverts the camera contract — see modifier): accumulation runs under a **slow steady zoom-out** —
  `[sticky notes]` bounce in springy, `[dashboard / editor windows]` pop and slide up, a stack of
  `[alert toasts]` slides in at one edge, inner content keeps typing / log-scrolling as live density,
  windows overlap until the frame is chaotically full. The camera then REVERSES into a quick
  push-in that **shoves the clutter to the frame edges**, opening central negative space where a
  `[two-part serif question]` builds word-by-word (line 1 swaps in place to line 2); a `[cursor]`
  glides in from off-frame and comes to rest under the text; a very slow forward creep and hold.
  No morph, no avatar — the question is the payoff.

**motion vocabulary**: staggered scale-in assembly; resting-scale-preserving low float; density-marker icon scatter; content-fade → container-reshape → reveal-anchor-beneath morph; radial close-in entry from all compass points; held crowded end-state. Clutter-shove variant: slow steady zoom-out under accumulation; reverse quick push-in; clutter
shoved to frame edges opening center negative space; continuous live typing / log scroll inside
windows as ambient density; toast-stack slide-in; word-by-word serif build with in-place line swap;
cursor glide-to-rest; very slow forward creep + hold.

**rule mapping**

- staggered mockup + icon entries (smooth settle onto their resting scale) → `spring-pop-entrance` (smooth-settle register) backed by `gsap-effects`
- platform icons as density markers (positions pre-baked, scale/opacity only — NOT internal-parts animation) → `svg-icon-enrichment` (its DOM contract only)
- center mockup → avatar morph (HF forbids `width`/`height` tweens → drive the reshape on `scaleX`/`scaleY`, anchor = the avatar layer rendered beneath) → `card-morph-anchor`
- radial bubble close-in (positions baked once via `cos`/`sin`, staggered entry) → `gsap-effects` (radial layout) + `spring-pop-entrance` (per-bubble arrival)
- low-amplitude float on background mockups/icons → `sine-wave-loop` (low-amplitude register — subtle jitter that composes onto each element's resting scale, never a `fromTo` yoyo that re-tweens to its start)
- (variant) zoom-out under accumulation → quick push-in → slow forward creep → `multi-phase-camera`
  (pull-back / push / drift as sequential phases on one world wrapper; counter-translate math in
  `viewport-change`)
- (variant) clutter shoved to the edges as the push-in lands → `center-outward-expansion` (outward
  vectors to edge resting positions), fired at the same timeline position as the camera push so the
  shove reads as CAUSED by it (`reactive-displacement` register)
- (variant) word-by-word serif question build → `gsap-effects` (staggered word reveal); the
  in-place line-1 → line-2 swap → `discrete-text-sequence`
- (variant) live typing inside windows → `gsap-effects` (typewriter); the continuous inner
  log-scroll — composition: looping content translateY via `gsap-effects` (masked)
- (variant) cursor glide-in coming to rest → `cursor-click-ripple` (approach portion only — no click)

**camera modifier**: camera-static — the close-in must read as the world crowding the subject, so the frame holds; a push-in would convert "surrounded" into "zoomed-into" and kill the claustrophobia. The clutter-shove-to-question variant is the sanctioned exception: there the camera IS the
storyteller (zoom-out ↔ push-in via `multi-phase-camera`), and the claustrophobia comes from
accumulation, not surround — never mix the two resolutions in one shot.

# Depth Scatter ↔ Assemble

N elements (glyphs, cards, logo fragments) fly in from a rotating 3D depth-cloud and lock into a flat layout — or the reverse. Each element has its OWN index-derived point in the cloud (translateZ depth + rotateX/Y tumble + x/y scatter). Distinct from `orbit-3d-entry` (flip-in then continuous orbit) and `center-outward-expansion` (flat burst from one shared center): here the resolve is a flat assembled layout.

## How It Works

Each element's flat target lives in `data-target-x/y`; its scattered state is pure trig on its index — golden-angle spread, stepped depth — so the cloud is byte-identical every render with no `Math.random`:

```js
const GOLDEN = Math.PI * (3 - Math.sqrt(5)); // ~2.39943 rad — even spread, no clumping
const a = i * GOLDEN;
const scatterX = Math.cos(a) * RADIUS;
const scatterY = Math.sin(a) * RADIUS;
const scatterZ = Z_NEAR - (i / (n - 1)) * (Z_NEAR - Z_FAR); // stepped depth
const rotX = Math.sin(a) * TUMBLE;
const rotY = Math.cos(a) * TUMBLE;
```

Elements are PARKED at their scatter points (`gsap.set`, opacity 0) before any tween, then each tweens to its flat target while the whole stage slowly rotates so the scatter has life before it locks. Requires `perspective` on the scene root and `preserve-3d` on the stage AND each element, or depth + tumble flatten to a 2D scale.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="cloud-stage">
  <div class="frag" data-target-x="-260" data-target-y="0">{glyph1}</div>
  <div class="frag" data-target-x="-130" data-target-y="0">{glyph2}</div>
  <!-- … one .frag per glyph / fragment … -->
</div>
```

```css
.scene-root {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  perspective: 1400px; /* REQUIRED */
}
.cloud-stage {
  position: relative;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
  will-change: transform;
}
.frag {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
  backface-visibility: hidden; /* hides the mirrored face mid-tumble */
  will-change: transform, opacity;
}
```

```js
const frags = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(".frag"));
const n = frags.length;
const GOLDEN = Math.PI * (3 - Math.sqrt(5));

// 1) Park every fragment in the cloud BEFORE any tween fires
const scatter = frags.map((el, i) => {
  const a = i * GOLDEN;
  const depthT = n > 1 ? i / (n - 1) : 0;
  return {
    x: Math.cos(a) * RADIUS,
    y: Math.sin(a) * RADIUS,
    z: Z_NEAR - depthT * (Z_NEAR - Z_FAR),
    rotationX: Math.sin(a) * TUMBLE,
    rotationY: Math.cos(a) * TUMBLE,
  };
});
frags.forEach((el, i) => gsap.set(el, { xPercent: -50, yPercent: -50, ...scatter[i], opacity: 0 }));

// 2) The cloud rotates so the scatter has life during assembly
tl.to(
  ".cloud-stage",
  { rotationY: CLOUD_SPIN_DEG, duration: CLOUD_SPIN_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  0,
);

// 3) ASSEMBLE — cloud point → flat target, index stagger = cloud collapsing inward
frags.forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.to(
    el,
    {
      x: Number(el.dataset.targetX),
      y: Number(el.dataset.targetY),
      z: 0,
      rotationX: 0,
      rotationY: 0,
      opacity: 1,
      duration: ASSEMBLE_DUR,
      ease: ASSEMBLE_EASE,
    },
    i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Tumble-swap** (the beat-change hand-off): two glyph sets share the cloud; ONE shared 0→1 progress tween drives both in its `onUpdate` — outgoing lerps layout→cloud with `opacity: 1−p`, incoming lerps cloud→layout with `opacity: p`. Two separate tweens drift out of phase under seek and the cross stops reading as one hand-off. Inject per-glyph spans per phrase at setup (measure advance widths after `document.fonts.ready` — single-scene only).
- **Radial letter-explode → resolve**: flat-plane special case — `Z_NEAR = Z_FAR = 0`, small `TUMBLE`; reverse the assemble for the explode. Pure in-plane.
- **Scatter-OUT**: reverse assemble (layout → cloud, opacity 1→0) ONLY as the composition's final beat — mid-shot it reads as the shot ending.
- **Parallax lockup**: back layers get deeper `|Z_FAR|` + longer `ASSEMBLE_DUR`, foreground shallower/shorter — depth-speeded slide-in that locks into the logo.

| SWAP_DUR               | 0.5–1.0s              | on the beat boundary; shorter = hard cross                                    |

## Critical Constraints

- **Every scattered value is index-derived** — `cos/sin(i × GOLDEN)` + stepped `z`. The golden angle spreads points evenly with no clumps and no `Math.random`.
- **`gsap.set` the cloud BEFORE adding tweens** — skipping it leaves frame 0 showing the assembled layout, then a teleport when the first tween starts.
- **`perspective` + `preserve-3d` on stage AND each fragment** — missing any one flattens the depth.
- **Resolve flat** — settled state is `z: 0`, rotations 0; a still-tilted resolve reads unfinished.
- **Tumble-swap: one shared progress for both glyph sets.**
- **Depth ordering is automatic** inside `preserve-3d` (paint order follows actual Z) — no manual z-index, unlike the orbit case's capped band.

## Selected motion rule: counting-dynamic-scale

description: Counter animation where the value counts up while transform scale grows to its final size, creating escalating visual weight without per-frame text reflow.

# Counting with Dynamic Scale

A number counts from A → B while its transform scale grows to the final size — escalating visual weight ("this is impressive") without tweening `font-size` or forcing text layout on every frame. The final font size is static CSS; only the transform changes.

## How It Works

Two synchronized tweens at the SAME timeline position with the SAME ease: (1) a proxy value rendered as text via `onUpdate` (`Math.round(...).toLocaleString()`), (2) the counter's transform `scale: START_SCALE → 1`, where `START_SCALE = START_SIZE / END_SIZE`. A suffix (`%`, `×`, `+`) slides in AFTER the count lands — the number gets its own beat — and a label fades in early.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="counter-wrap">
  <span class="counter" id="counter">0</span><span class="counter-suffix">{suffix}</span>
</div>
<div class="counter-label">{label}</div>
```

```css
.counter-wrap {
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  justify-content: center;
  width: {counterContainerWidth}; /* fixed width — no layout shift as digit count changes */
}
.counter {
  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums; /* MANDATORY — digits keep equal width */
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: {endSize}; /* final size is static; GSAP animates scale, not font-size */
  transform-origin: center center;
}
.counter-suffix {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(20px);
}
```

```js
const counter = document.getElementById("counter");
const state = { value: 0 };
const START_SCALE = START_SIZE / END_SIZE;

// Count value — onUpdate changes text only
tl.to(
  state,
  {
    value: TARGET_VALUE,
    duration: COUNT_DUR,
    ease: COUNT_EASE,
    onUpdate: () => {
      counter.textContent = Math.round(state.value).toLocaleString();
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Visual growth — compositor transform sharing the count's timing + ease
tl.fromTo(counter, { scale: START_SCALE }, { scale: 1, duration: COUNT_DUR, ease: COUNT_EASE }, 0);

// Suffix slides in AFTER the count completes
tl.to(
  ".counter-suffix",
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUFFIX_DUR, ease: `back.out(${SUFFIX_BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  COUNT_DUR,
);

// Label fades in early
tl.from(".counter-label", { opacity: 0, y: 12, duration: LABEL_DUR, ease: "power2.out" }, LABEL_AT);
```

## Variations

- **Direct `innerText` tween (no proxy)** — GSAP can tween `innerText` directly for a number-only counter; keep the proxy form when you need locale formatting or suffix logic. The scale tween stays separate either way:

```js
tl.to(
  counter,
  { innerText: TARGET_VALUE, duration: COUNT_DUR, ease: COUNT_EASE, snap: { innerText: 1 } },
  0,
);
```

- **3D depth entry** — add a `tl.from(".counter", { z: -300, ... }, 0)` push-in; requires `perspective` on `.counter-wrap` and `transform-style: preserve-3d` on the counter.
- **Multi-stat coordinated reveal** — 3 stats counting in parallel share the SAME ease, duration, and start position so they finish together (a chord, not an arpeggio). Each stat usually also needs a paired graphic (bar / ring / stars) — don't stop at the number; see [stat-bars-and-fills.md](stat-bars-and-fills.md).

| START_SIZE / END_SIZE | START ≈ 40–60% of END                       | design inputs used once for START_SCALE; never tween either                   |

| COUNT_EASE            | `power2.out` / `power3.out` ⭐ / `expo.out` | shared by value + scale; more `.out` = more dramatic deceleration at the peak |

| SUFFIX_BOUNCE_FACTOR  | 1.4–2.0                                     | overshoot is fine on the suffix (it's punctuation, not data)                  |
| LABEL_AT / LABEL_DUR  | AT < COUNT_DUR/2; 0.4–0.7s                  | label arrives before the count peaks                                          |

## Critical Constraints

- **`tabular-nums` mandatory** + fixed-width container as belt-and-suspenders — without them digit-count transitions (9 → 10 → 100) jitter as glyph widths change.
- **Never set `fontSize` in `onUpdate`** — final type size is static CSS; only the transform changes per frame. Keep `onUpdate` O(1): set text only, no style writes or DOM creation.
- **`Math.round`, not `Math.floor`** — halfway through the final integer should already display the final value.
- **Avoid `back.out` / `elastic.out` on the counter itself** — overshoot makes the number look unstable (it's data, not decoration). Grow in place, don't bounce.
- **Label is BIG TEXT, not a page-style caption** — a tiny paragraph under a hero-size number reads as visual noise in video. Display-size, uppercase, tracked: the label is part of the headline.
