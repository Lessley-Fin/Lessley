Adapt: keep the *satellites clear and the mark resolves into a centered lockup, extended to the
CTA* signature. The satellites are the same ten chips that opened the pain in Frame 2 — so the
collapse is a structural rhyme, not decoration: the thing that overwhelmed the viewer at 0:06
becomes the single card they now hold.
Scene 1 (0.0–1.6s): the **circle wipe** takes navy and swallows the device. The ten club chips
re-enter from the frame edges to the same scattered positions they held in Frame 2 — the
viewer recognises the arrangement before they can name why.
Scene 2 (1.6–3.2s): the chips **collapse inward toward one center** — the inverse of
`center-outward-expansion` — converging on a single card that **scale-swaps** into existence as
they arrive (`scale-swap-transition`), each chip streaking slightly on the way in.
Scene 3 (3.2–4.4s): the card resolves into the `logo-with-name` lockup, its outline
**self-drawing** as it settles (`svg-path-draw`). Centered, ~62% of frame width.
Scene 4 (4.4–5.4s): `טייס אוטומטי פיננסי לכל רכישה` reveals per-word right→left beneath the
lockup; then `התחילו בחינם` **spring-pops** in as a solid teal pill (the Frame 2 entrance) with
`https://lessley.cs.colman.ac.il` beneath it in Heebo 600, forced LTR inside its own isolation
span so the bidi algorithm cannot reorder it against the surrounding Hebrew.
Scene 5 (5.4–6.0s): **held to the final frame.** This is the video's only real exit — every
other frame exits through its injected transition. Fully still; **subtle jitter** only.

`onscreen:`
1. Ten club chips converge and collapse into one card.
2. `Lessley` lockup resolves.
3. `טייס אוטומטי פיננסי לכל רכישה`
4. `התחילו בחינם` + `https://lessley.cs.colman.ac.il`

narrativeRole: Restates the whole video in one image — ten fragmented memberships become
one thing you check. The CTA is low-risk by design because the ask follows a video that
spent its whole length proving the mechanism.
keyMessage: Ten clubs, one autopilot. Free to start.

**The CTA URL is confirmed:** `https://lessley.cs.colman.ac.il` (user, 21/08). The repository's
`lessley.example.com` is a placeholder and must never appear on screen. Render the URL in
Heebo 600 at LTR direction inside its own isolation span so the bidi algorithm cannot
reorder it against the surrounding Hebrew.

## Selected blueprint: logo-assemble-lockup

# logo-assemble-lockup — Logo Assemble → Lockup

**intent**: A brand mark / wordmark comes to exist on screen and resolves into a centered logo lockup — built from parts (elements assemble or orbit in, letters cascade, an outline draws on, or a camera pushes through negative space), spring-BLOOMED whole from zero on a cleared stage, MORPHED in one unbroken chain out of the preceding phrase / glyph, absorbed from a kinetic streak, or already assembled and settling as decorations clear — optionally extended into a final URL / CTA / end card.

**roles served**

- Product_Intro (from product-intro-logo-system-assemble): A wordless, premium brand STING — an abstract system of elements pulses / grows / orbits and assembles around a FIXED central logo, carried by one cinematic camera tilt; no copy, no UI.
- CTA (from cta-camera-push-lockup): The logo build is a LEAD-IN to the final ask — a 3D mark assembles + wordmark cascades, then a fast camera PUSH-THROUGH the mark's negative space streaks giant CTA letters past the lens and resolves on a `[url]` / `[CTA verb]` lockup.
- CTA (from cta-button-wordmark-build): The "draws-its-own-outline → wordmark-builds-letter-by-letter" sub-shape — a `[CTA button]` pill strokes its own glowing border, a diagonal-band WIPE flips the frame, and the `[wordmark]` types in beside a slash to land the lockup. Camera static.
- Brand_Outro (from brand-outro-assemble-logo-lockup): The closing mark — a formation of `[feature pills / UI elements]` CLEARS the stage off all four edges, then on the empty frame the `[logo mark]` draws itself on stroke-by-stroke and the `[wordmark]` reveals to complete the lockup, then fades out.
- Product_Intro (from brand-reveal-assemble-zoom): a context-then-focus reveal — a companion tagline TYPES out to set context, the hero mark pops in beside it, then the companion exits as the layout recenters and the camera pushes IN to a held close-up on the mark (wide composition narrowing to a tight focus).
- Product_Intro (from logo-parts-lockup-assembly): the literal parts build — `[icon parts]` (a glowing dot traces a circle, semi-circles scale up and overlap, strokes rotate in) converge into the `[brand icon]` center-frame on a flat / gradient field, the `[wordmark]` joins (± a `[badge pill]` pops onto the lockup), then a payoff beat: a stepped bottom `[subtitle rail]`, a big `[count-up stat]` over a faint asset grid, or the lockup clears and a `[product UI window]` scales in. Static frame, all element-level.
- CTA (from text-clears-mark-blooms-lockup): the text-clear BLOOM — centered `[serif tagline]` beats (word-by-word staggered fades) hold, then CLEAR themselves to a blank frame; the `[brand mark]` spring-blooms from ZERO at dead center, slides left as the `[wordmark]` reveals to its right, and the balanced lockup holds (near-)still. Constant warm flat bg, static frame.
- Brand_Outro (from phrase-morphs-into-lockup): the MORPH chain — a centered `[phrase]` mutates in place, then collapses / swaps into an `[intermediate glyph]` whose line panels fan-and-flip around a central pivot with visible motion blur (page-flip feel) and interlock into the `[geometric mark]`, which slides apart into the lockup. One unbroken chain of transformation, never a cut-and-replace assembly; the finished lockup holds dead static for the final ~40–50% of runtime.
- Brand_Outro (from lead-text-then-mark-assembles): the parts-arrive build — a `[hand-off line]` holds and departs, then the mark is BUILT from arriving parts (`[icon]` drops in, letters slide in one by one, terminal punctuation lands, a confetti burst pops and instantly shrinks) OR a `[pixel stack]` streaks into full-width multicolor stripes whose tail retracts and is ABSORBED into the pixel mark — finishing as a lockup or a full end card (`[icon tile]` + `[title]` + `[URL pill]` + store badges) held static.
- Brand_Outro (from `settled-lockup-reveal`): the null-assembly boundary — the `[lockup]` is on stage from frame one; `[satellite shapes]` drift outward and fade, an accent underline sweeps beneath the wordmark, and the `[tagline]` wipes in to complete it. Settle-and-reveal: no predecessor beat, no morph, no relay.

**duration**: ~4.4–11.0s (Brand_Outro ~4.4–7.3s · brand-reveal ~5s · CTA text-clear bloom 6.0–8.9s · Product_Intro ~7s orbit sting, 7.0–9.8s parts-assembly · CTA push/build 5.4–11.0s)

**shot structure** (one consolidated time-coded template; `[slots]` are product-agnostic)

- Scene 1 — clear / ignite (0.0–~1.0s): the stage is prepared for the mark to build into.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro_: opens on a clean `[light bg]` with faint concentric guide rings under a flat top-down view; rings PULSE and expand from center; mid-beat the bg crossfades `[light]→[dark gradient: hero→secondary]`, tiny seed dots appear along the rings, and the central `[logo mark]`'s glow IGNITES (mark is present from t=0, fixed, front-facing).
  - _Variant — CTA push_: on a `[bg gradient]`, the `[logo mark]` is settling in object space (a 3D mark with thin wireframe edge-guides + a faint bracket motif behind center); a very slow continuous camera push-in may already be creeping.
  - _Variant — CTA button-build_: on a `[dark grid bg]`, a rounded `[CTA button "label"]` pill rises / scales into center (a prior headline clearing off the top); its thin border DRAWS ON as an animated glowing outline STROKE, with a small `[accent]` comet / spark icon at its left edge.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro_: a PRE-ARRANGED formation of `[feature pills / element grid]` (each `[icon]`+`[label]`) DISPERSES — elements slide outward from their laid-out positions and fly off all four frame edges (edge-clearing drift, NOT a center-origin burst), emptying the frame onto a clean `[bg]`.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro parts-assembly_ (from logo-parts-lockup-assembly): optional text hook — a centered "`[Meet product]`" line wipes away right→left — or straight into the build; on a flat / gradient `[bg]`, the first `[icon parts]` arrive: a glowing dot traces a clockwise circle, a gradient semi-circle scales up inside it, or the mark scales-up-with-rotate into center.
  - _Variant — CTA text-clear bloom_ (from text-clears-mark-blooms-lockup): a centered `[serif tagline / question]` (± an outlined `[badge pill]`) finishes a left→right word-staggered reveal in the first ~0.5–1s (each word passing light-grey→dark) and HOLDS; optional rolling word-by-word swap to a second `[availability line]`. Then the CLEAR: text exits — shrink-toward-center + fade, or word-by-word left-first fade-out — leaving a blank frame for a beat.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro morph-chain_ (from phrase-morphs-into-lockup): a centered `[phrase]` completes or mutates in place (a vertical slot-machine word swap — one word exits up as its replacement rises from below, rest of the line fixed — or a word-by-word landing) and holds. Nothing clears: the phrase IS the raw material for the mark.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro parts-arrive_ (from lead-text-then-mark-assembles): a centered `[hand-off line: tagline / "Brought to you by"]` holds on a flat canvas, then exits — slides straight down off-frame with fade, or fades away behind the incoming flourish.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro settled-reveal_ (from settled-lockup-reveal): the `[lockup]` is already centered at t=0; `[satellite shapes]` drift slowly outward around it — an INVERTED clear: the decorations leave, the mark stays.

- Scene 2 — assemble the mark (~1.0–~Ys): the mark builds itself from parts.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro_: seed dots SCALE UP into flat `[accent]` shapes arranged on the rings; concentric bands ripple outward (tunneling feel) and the shapes begin to ORBIT / drift around the still-fixed center.
  - _Variant — CTA push_: the `[wordmark]` CASCADES out from behind the mark (letters left→right with overshoot) into the full `[brand lockup]`; the 3D mark may assemble in beats (a terminal detaches + pops as a spring dot, a part hinges-open-and-snaps-shut elastic). Optional beat: a `[cursor]` arcs in and "clicks" the wordmark, OR a frosted-glass pill holding an intermediate `[CTA line]` springs in while layered mark shells fan to the edges.
  - _Variant — CTA button-build_: a graphic WIPE flips the frame to `[contrast bg]` — a thin `[accent]` diagonal line sweeps in, swells into a full-frame diagonal BAND, then collapses to a small `[accent]` slash.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro_: on the now-clear frame, the `[logo mark]` DRAWS ON via stroke (built arc-by-arc / segment-by-segment).
  - _Variant — Product_Intro parts-assembly_: the overlapping parts COMPLETE the `[brand icon]` (a second circle overlaps to close the orb; strokes interlock); the `[wordmark]` slides out from behind the icon or in from its right; a small `[badge pill]` pops onto the lockup.
  - _Variant — CTA text-clear bloom_: on the blank frame the `[brand mark]` scales up from ZERO at dead center with a snappy spring ease (slight overshoot, hint of rotation as it grows) — the whole mark at once, no parts.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro morph-chain_: the phrase collapses / wipes horizontally into the mark, OR is instantly swapped at the same center for a line-art `[intermediate icon]` whose strokes split into panels that fan-and-flip around a central pivot with visible motion blur, interlock-settling into the `[geometric mark]`. Never a cut to the finished logo — the transformation must stay unbroken.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro parts-arrive_: the mark is BUILT from arriving parts — the `[icon]` drops in from above, letters slide in one by one, terminal punctuation lands, a tiny confetti burst pops and instantly shrinks — OR a colored `[pixel stack]` pops in at a text edge, shoots horizontally stretching into full-width multicolor stripes, then the stripe tail retracts and is ABSORBED into the `[pixel mark]` (mask retraction).
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro settled-reveal_: an accent underline sweeps left→right beneath the `[wordmark]` — the only "build" this variant performs.

- Scene 3 — resolve to lockup (~Ys–end): the lockup completes and holds (Product_Intro / Brand_Outro) or is flown into / extended to a CTA (CTA variants).
  - _Variant — Product_Intro (the ONE camera move)_: the whole system smoothly TILTS from flat top-down into an angled isometric perspective (ease-in-out) with a slight zoom-out — flat shapes become luminous 3D forms, bands become glowing orbit lines, while the central `[logo mark]` does NOT tilt (stays 2D, front-facing, fixed). Camera eases to a stop; elements keep continuous orbit/drift (inner faster than outer); the mark holds its steady glow. Final settled frame.
  - _Variant — CTA push (the signature)_: a single fast CAMERA PUSH-THROUGH the mark's negative space / through the glass pill — heavy horizontal motion-blur, giant `[CTA]` letters streaking past the lens (cursor drops out). Resolves to the final lockup on a saturated `[bg]`: a `[url badge]` / `[CTA line]` revealed by a left→right WIPE carrying an `[accent]` leading edge (or a clean fade), with solid mark-shapes parallax-sliding in behind. Settles to a dead-static hold (slow zoom-out / settle).
  - _Variant — CTA button-build_: the `[wordmark]` BUILDS letter-by-letter to the right of the slash, landing on the final "`[slash] [WORDMARK]`" lockup centered on the new bg. Slow settle to static.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro_: the `[wordmark]` reveals beside the drawn mark (slide / fade) to complete the `[lockup]`; the lockup holds, then fades to `[black / bg]`.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro parts-assembly (the payoff beat)_: the finished lockup holds while a bottom `[subtitle box]` steps through `[tagline fragments]` (swap-in-place); or a big `[count-up stat]` line lands over a faint background asset grid; or the lockup scales-down / fades and a `[product UI window]` scales up on the flat bg (its panel content may swap once). The build hands off to product proof.
  - _Variant — CTA text-clear bloom_: the mark slides a short distance LEFT while the `[wordmark]` reveals to its right (letter-by-letter / slide-out wipe with visible partial states); the balanced "`[mark] + [wordmark]`" lockup centers and holds, one member continuing an almost imperceptible slow scale-up through the hold.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro morph-chain_: the mark slides left as the `[wordmark]` is pulled out rightward trailing a motion-blur streak, the pair decelerating into the centered lockup (± a `[sub-line]` fades in below). The hold is LONG — dead static for the final ~40–50% of runtime.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro parts-arrive_: the lockup rests centered and holds; or the full end card completes — a rounded-square `[icon tile]` scales up behind the mark, the `[title]` fades in word-by-word, and a bottom row (`[URL pill]` + `[store badges]`) fades / slides up — then holds static.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro settled-reveal_: the `[tagline]` reveals left→right below the wordmark; the satellites finish drifting out and fade; the lockup holds centered (at most a very slow global zoom-out, no pan).

**motion vocabulary**: ring pulse / expand; background crossfade (light→dark); glow ignite; seed-dot scale-up; continuous orbit / drift (inner faster than outer); single 3D perspective tilt (flat→isometric) + slight zoom-out around a fixed 2D anchor; 3D logo assemble (part detach + spring dot, clapperboard hinge / snap, shell fan-out); wordmark cascade with overshoot (letters left→right); button pill rise / scale-in; animated stroke-outline DRAW + glow (button border AND logo mark); comet / spark accent; diagonal-band wipe (sweep → swell → collapse-to-slash); letter-by-letter wordmark build; pre-formed grid DISPERSE off all four edges; logo-mark stroke-draw (sequential arcs / segments); fast CAMERA PUSH-THROUGH with motion-blur (CTA spine); continuous slow push-in / push-out; cursor arc-in + click; parallax shape slide-in; left→right URL/badge wipe with glowing leading edge; static / fade-out end-lockup hold; optional idle breathe on the held mark; glowing-dot circular path trace; part-overlap icon completion (semi-circles scale up + overlap); scale-up-with-rotate mark entrance; wordmark slide-out-from-behind-icon; badge pill pop onto the lockup; stepped subtitle swap-in-place (bottom rail); count-up stat tick over a faint asset grid; lockup shrink / fade → UI-window scale-up payoff; word-by-word staggered fade-through-grey (in, and left-first out); rolling word-by-word line swap; shrink-toward-center + fade clearing exit; whole-mark spring BLOOM from zero (overshoot + slight rotation); near-imperceptible continuous scale-up through the hold; vertical slot-machine word swap; horizontal phrase collapse / wipe into the mark; instant same-center text→icon swap; line-panel fan-and-flip morph around a central pivot with motion blur (page-flip feel); interlock-settle into the geometric mark; wordmark pull-out trailing a motion-blur streak; lead-line slide-down-off-bottom exit; icon drop-in from above; sequential per-letter slide-in + terminal punctuation landing; confetti burst pop-then-instant-shrink; pixel-stack pop at a text edge; horizontal streak-stretch into full-width stripes; stripe-tail retraction absorbed into the mark (mask retraction); rounded-tile scale-up enclosing the mark; bottom metadata row fade / slide-up (URL pill + store badges); satellite shapes outward drift + fade; left→right underline sweep; left→right tagline wipe-in.

**rule mapping** (per motion verb → `rules/<id>.md`)

- ring pulse / expand from center → `center-outward-expansion` (radiate from a shared center; reuse the 0→1 progress driver)
- background crossfade (light→dark gradient) → plain opacity/background tween via `gsap-effects` (no dedicated rule needed)
- glow ignite on the mark → `asr-keyword-glow` (envelope-driven glow on the brand element)
- seed-dot scale-up into shapes → `spring-pop-entrance` (scale-in pop; alt `scale-swap-transition` if dots morph into shapes)
- continuous orbit / drift around fixed center → `orbit-3d-entry` (flip-in then continuous elliptical orbit; center label = the fixed mark)
- single 3D perspective tilt (flat→isometric) + slight zoom-out → `multi-phase-camera` (scripted scale phases on a scene-wrapping camera, for the zoom-out) — see camera modifier; the FLAT→ISOMETRIC plane tilt of the whole stage is a CSS-3D perspective move (`techniques.md` CSS-3D, animating the stage's `rotateX`) — no exact camera rule for the plane-tilt, approximate via CSS-3D (closest reference is `orbit-3d-entry`'s "Tilted orbit plane" variation animated over time)
- fixed 2D anchor logo amid moving universe → no motion rule needed (static anchor; intentional — it's the absence of motion, the universe moves around it)
- 3D logo assemble — part detach + spring dot → `spring-pop-entrance` (spring pop, `back.out` overshoot)
- 3D logo assemble — hinge open / snap (clapperboard) → `hacker-flip-3d` (the 3D-rotate axis) + `techniques.md` CSS-3D (the elastic open-and-snap-shut hinge is an adaptation of the 3D-rotate)
- 3D logo assemble — shell fan-out to edges → `center-outward-expansion` (run outward from the mark center)
- wordmark cascade with overshoot (letters left→right) → recipe `gsap-effects` (per-element staggered slide) + `spring-pop-entrance` (the `back.out` overshoot per letter)
- button pill rise / scale-in → `spring-pop-entrance` (scale-in; alt `scale-swap-transition`)
- animated stroke-outline draw + glow (button border) → `svg-path-draw` (stroke-dashoffset draw) + `asr-keyword-glow` (the glow on the drawn stroke)
- comet / spark accent on button → `asr-keyword-glow` (small glow accent); motion path via `techniques.md` GSAP MotionPathPlugin (#9)
- diagonal-band wipe (sweep → swell → collapse-to-slash) → `techniques.md` clip-path reveal (#12, animate a `polygon(...)` diagonal across the frame; the swell-then-collapse-to-slash is the same clip-path reveal driven through grow→shrink keyframes)
- letter-by-letter wordmark build → `discrete-text-sequence` (smooth-slice / per-state build); recipe `gsap-effects` (typewriter / appending words)
- pre-formed grid disperse off all four edges → not a rule gap: a formation flying off-frame is an EXIT, and the pipeline forbids mid-video exits — the harness transition IS the exit (only the final frame may exit the stage). Treat this as transition-handled / final-frame-only rather than an in-scene motion rule. (If staged in-scene as a reveal-the-mark clear, it reuses `center-outward-expansion` run OUTWARD — center→target machinery interpolating formation→offscreen targets, out-easing.)
- logo-mark stroke-draw (sequential arcs / segments) → `svg-path-draw` (the canonical multi-segment stagger draw)
- wordmark slide / fade reveal beside drawn mark → `svg-path-draw` (its "brand-line fades in after stroke" tail) ; slide via `spring-pop-entrance`
- fast camera push-through with motion-blur → `multi-phase-camera` (a hard push phase) — see camera modifier; the heavy motion-blur streak itself → `motion-blur-streak` (directional velocity blur on the fast push-through)
- continuous slow push-in / push-out → `multi-phase-camera` (phase scale + drift)
- cursor arc-in + click on the wordmark → `cursor-click-ripple` (move → click → ripple); arc path via `techniques.md` MotionPathPlugin (#9)
- parallax shape slide-in behind lockup → `depth-scatter-assemble` (parallax depth slide-in of shapes at differing depths; pair with `3d-text-depth-layers` for the depth ordering)
- left→right URL / badge wipe with glowing leading edge → `techniques.md` clip-path reveal (#12, animate `inset()` left→right); the glowing leading edge → `asr-keyword-glow`
- static / fade-out end-lockup hold → no motion rule needed (terminal hold / opacity fade; intentional)
- idle breathe on held mark (optional) → `sine-wave-loop` (post-settle breathing)
- glowing-dot circular path trace → `svg-path-draw` (the traced circle draws on) + `techniques.md` MotionPathPlugin (#9) for the leading dot riding the path tip
- part-overlap icon completion / semi-circle scale-up → `spring-pop-entrance` (per-part scale-in; place parts at their final overlap positions from setup — the overlap IS the completed mark)
- scale-up-with-rotate mark entrance → `spring-pop-entrance` (add a rotation from-value to the pop)
- wordmark slide-out-from-behind-icon → recipe `gsap-effects` (x-slide) under a clip / overflow mask via `techniques.md` clip-path reveal (#12); z-order the icon above the sliding text
- badge pill pop onto the lockup → `spring-pop-entrance`
- stepped subtitle swap-in-place (bottom rail) → `discrete-text-sequence` (whole-state replacement at time thresholds); derive the windows via `dynamic-content-sequencing`
- count-up stat tick over a faint asset grid → `counting-dynamic-scale`; the faint grid is a plain opacity fade (no rule needed)
- lockup shrink / fade → UI-window payoff → `scale-swap-transition` (exit cluster shrinks + fades at center; window pops in with `back.out`)
- word-by-word staggered fade-through-grey (in / left-first out) → recipe `gsap-effects` (per-word staggered opacity + color tween). Deliberately a quiet FADE register — do NOT substitute `waterfall-entry` here; its binary-arrival doctrine is the wrong voice for this serif beat
- rolling word-by-word line swap → two overlapping `gsap-effects` word staggers at the same timeline position (old line out left-first, new line in left→right)
- shrink-toward-center + fade clearing exit → `scale-swap-transition` (its exit half; the entrance half is the bloom)
- whole-mark spring BLOOM from zero → `spring-pop-entrance` (single hero, `back.out` overshoot, slight rotation from-value)
- near-imperceptible continuous scale-up through the hold → no motion rule needed (one long linear micro-tween on the held lockup; intentional life-in-the-hold)
- vertical slot-machine word swap → `vertical-spring-ticker` (masked column, stepped tween — one word slot cycles, rest of the line fixed)
- horizontal phrase collapse / wipe into the mark → `scale-swap-transition` (same-center morph) with the collapse via `techniques.md` clip-path reveal (#12)
- instant same-center text→icon swap → no motion rule needed (`tl.set` hard swap; intentional — the chain's continuity lives in the NEXT beat's morph)
- line-panel fan-and-flip morph (page-flip, motion-blurred) → `hacker-flip-3d` (the per-panel 3D rotation axis) + `motion-blur-streak` (the blur) + `techniques.md` CSS-3D; true stroke-interpolation glyph morphs live in `hyperframes-keyframes` (SVG morph) — reach there if panels can't sell it
- interlock-settle into the geometric mark → `center-outward-expansion` machinery run INWARD (per-panel transform offsets tween to 0 in lockstep with one driver)
- wordmark pull-out trailing a motion-blur streak → `motion-blur-streak` (echo / ghost trail collapsing into the lead) on the x-slide
- lead-line slide-down-off-bottom exit → in-scene clearing beat; same doctrine as the grid-disperse row above (offscreen target + out-easing; prefer the harness transition when the exit IS the scene boundary)
- icon drop-in from above → `spring-pop-entrance` (y-offset from-value, overshoot on landing)
- sequential per-letter slide-in + terminal punctuation landing → `waterfall-entry` (staggered arrival cascade on a lateral axis; the punctuation is the cascade's final, heaviest beat)
- confetti burst pop-then-instant-shrink → `press-release-spring` ("release burst" variation) for a small deterministic burst; a true multi-particle confetti field → `particle-burst`
- pixel-stack pop at a text edge → `spring-pop-entrance` (tight stagger down the stack)
- horizontal streak-stretch into full-width stripes → plain `scaleX` stretch via `gsap-effects` (transform-origin at the stack) + `motion-blur-streak` for the streak read
- stripe-tail retraction absorbed into the mark → `techniques.md` clip-path reveal (#12) run in REVERSE (animated `inset()` retraction reading as mask absorption into the mark)
- rounded-tile scale-up enclosing the mark → `spring-pop-entrance` (scale-in BEHIND the mark; z-order only, mark never moves)
- bottom metadata row fade / slide-up → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered group, ≤500ms cap)
- satellite shapes outward drift + fade → `center-outward-expansion` run OUTWARD (drift targets past frame edge) + opacity tail; if the drift must idle first, seed it with `sine-wave-loop`
- left→right underline sweep → `css-marker-patterns` (highlight sweep re-skinned as an underline) or `stat-bars-and-fills` progress-fill `scaleX`
- left→right tagline wipe-in → the existing "left→right URL / badge wipe" row applies unchanged (clip-path `inset()`)

**camera modifier** (the push / tilt)

- **CTA push-through** (the CTA spine): a scripted hard zoom phase on a scene-wrapping camera → `multi-phase-camera` ("Steady push" / "Bookend pull" pattern; push phase = the climax). When the mark is OFF-center and the camera must fly through a specific point of negative space, combine with `coordinate-target-zoom` (outer scales, inner counter-translates so the target negative-space point lands at viewport center as scale ramps; measure the offset at setup). The signature heavy horizontal MOTION-BLUR on the streak → `motion-blur-streak` (directional velocity blur on the push); realize with a CSS `filter: blur()` / duplicated-streak layer on the camera during the push window.
- **Product_Intro tilt** (the one cinematic move): the flat→isometric perspective tilt + slight zoom-out is a single scripted camera beat → `multi-phase-camera` (scale phase + the "Targeted zoom into off-center element" / drift machinery) for the zoom-out. `multi-phase-camera` is scale+translate+drift only, so the perspective-PLANE rotateX (flat top-down → angled isometric) of the whole stage is the CSS-3D move noted above — approximate via `techniques.md` CSS-3D, animating the stage's `rotateX` (closest reference is `orbit-3d-entry`'s "Tilted orbit plane" variation animated over time).
- **Static-frame variants**: the parts-assembly, text-clear bloom, morph-chain, parts-arrive, and settled-reveal variants are all COMPLETELY static-frame (element-level motion only; settled-reveal tolerates at most a very slow global zoom-out). The camera modifier applies only to the CTA push and the Product_Intro tilt.

# Center-Outward Expansion

Elements begin at one shared center point and radiate outward to their final positions — the entry beat itself, or motion driven by another animation's progress (a counting number, a beat). Flat 2D cousin of [depth-scatter-assemble.md](depth-scatter-assemble.md) (per-element 3D cloud): here every element shares the SAME origin.

## How It Works

Each element carries its final offset as `data-target-x/y`. Its position lerps between center and target: `x = targetX × progress`. Self-centering is baked as `xPercent/yPercent: -50` so the tweened `x`/`y` are pure offsets from the stage center. Standalone burst = per-item staggered `fromTo`; driven burst = one shared proxy (see Variations).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="burst-wrap">
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="-360" data-target-y="-180">{itemA}</div>
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="360" data-target-y="-180">{itemB}</div>
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="0" data-target-y="360">{itemC}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.burst-wrap {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
.burst-item {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%; /* GSAP xPercent/yPercent -50 bakes the centering; x/y tween the offset */
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
document.querySelectorAll(".burst-item").forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    { xPercent: -50, yPercent: -50, x: 0, y: 0, scale: 0.6, opacity: 0 },
    {
      x: Number(el.dataset.targetX),
      y: Number(el.dataset.targetY),
      scale: 1,
      opacity: 1,
      duration: EXPAND_DUR,
      ease: EXPAND_EASE,
    },
    ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Synced to a driver (chord)**: when the burst shadows a counter / beat, drop the stagger and drive all items from ONE 0→1 proxy tween with the driver's exact duration AND ease; `onUpdate` writes `translate(-50%,-50%) translate(targetX*p, targetY*p)` per item — the two read as one beat.
- **Partially-spread start**: with 6+ items the full cluster piles up — start from `{ x: targetX * START_PROGRESS, ... }`.
- **Idle micro-float**: hand off to [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) after landing instead of freezing.

| -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ITEM_COUNT     | 3–8                  | > 8 = visual chaos mid-expansion; low counts want wider spread   |
| EXPAND_DUR     | 1.0–1.8s             | must equal the driver's duration in the synced variant           |
| EXPAND_EASE    | `power3.out` default | `power2.out` gentler, `expo.out` dramatic stop; NEVER `in` eases |
| STAGGER        | 0.04–0.08s           | tighter = chord; looser = lazy arpeggio                          |
| ENTRY_AT       | 0–0.5s               | a beat of compositional quiet before the burst                   |
| START_PROGRESS | 0–0.5                | 0 = dramatic full cluster; ~0.3 avoids the pile-up               |

## Critical Constraints

- **Tween `x`/`y` over the baked `xPercent/yPercent: -50`** — mutating `left`/`top` fights the centering and causes pixel jitter.
- **Out-easing only** — `in` easings read as items being sucked back mid-air.
- **No other absolute-positioned siblings inside `.burst-wrap`** — they'd steal the centered baseline.
- **❗ The burst IS the beat** — don't park a "real headline" label below it (the eye snaps to the label and ignores the burst). If a label is needed, reveal it post-burst in the same stack.
- Synced variant: identical duration + ease as the driver, or the chord falls apart.

description: Coordinated shrink-out + spring pop-in morph-like transition between two elements — no SVG path interpolation needed.

# Scale-Swap Transition

Simulates a "morph" between two DOM elements by overlapping exit and entrance scale animations. Lighter weight than [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (which morphs container dimensions — use that for SHAPE changes; this rule is for SAME-shape state swaps) and easier than SVG path interpolation.

At a single trigger, two coordinated tweens fire:

1. **Outgoing**: scale `1.0 → EXIT_SCALE` + opacity `1 → 0`, fast `power2.in` (rushing away).
2. **Incoming**: scale `EXIT_SCALE → 1.0` + opacity `0 → 1`, `back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` (arriving with weight).

A small `OVERLAP` window during which both are mid-tween creates the morph illusion; the incoming sits on top via z-index so the outgoing's fade-tail doesn't bleed through.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- Both cards position: absolute; inset: 0 in one fixed-size wrapper — same
     footprint, same transform-origin: 50% 50%. Incoming starts opacity: 0,
     transform: scale(EXIT_SCALE), z-index above the outgoing. -->
<div class="swap-wrap">
  <div class="card outgoing" id="outgoing">{outgoingIcon} {outgoingLabel}</div>
  <div class="card incoming" id="incoming">
    {incomingIcon} {incomingLabel}
    <div class="sub" id="sub">{incomingSubline}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
// Outgoing: shrink + fade fast
tl.to(
  "#outgoing",
  { scale: EXIT_SCALE, opacity: 0, duration: EXIT_DUR, ease: "power2.in" },
  TRIGGER,
);

// Incoming: pops in with overshoot, starting OVERLAP before the exit finishes
tl.to(
  "#incoming",
  { scale: 1.0, opacity: 1, duration: ENTER_DUR, ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR - OVERLAP,
);

// Inner content reveals AFTER the incoming settles
tl.fromTo(
  "#sub",
  { opacity: 0, y: SUB_REVEAL_Y_PX },
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUB_REVEAL_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR + SUB_REVEAL_DELAY,
);
```

## Variations

- **Delayed inner content reveal** — the classic pattern above: morph the container, then reveal inner text once it settles; the 0.2–0.4 s gap lets the eye land on the new shape before reading.
- **Triple swap (3-state cycle)** — chain A→B→C with triggers `TRIGGER_AB` / `TRIGGER_BC`; each transition is its own tween pair, the previous incoming becoming the next outgoing. State-evolution narratives (early → mid → final labels).
- **Color-shift transition (no scale)** — for a flat morph between same-shape states, drop the scale and keep opacity + a brief background hue tween; less dramatic, more product-UI tone.

## Critical Constraints

- **Incoming z-index ABOVE outgoing** — otherwise the outgoing's fade-tail (opacity 0.3–0.5) bleeds through and double-exposes the frame.
- **Both elements share `transform-origin: 50% 50%`** — different origins make the morph read as one thing teleporting elsewhere.
- **Bouncy ease ONLY on the incoming** — outgoing `power2.in`, incoming `back.out`; reversed, the swap feels mechanical.
- **Both cards `position: absolute; inset: 0`** in the same fixed-size wrapper (sized to fit both states; the wrap never resizes).
- **Don't `display: none` the outgoing** after the fade — leave it at `opacity: 0` so layout doesn't reflow.
- **Inner content reveals after the container settles**; **climax dwell ≥ 1 s** after the final state + subline land.

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.
