## Frame 12 — מגיע אליכם לבד

- scene: a live toast drops in over the phone and the notification feed fills behind it
- voiceover: ""
- duration: 5s
- transition_in: blur-crossfade
- status: outline
- src: compositions/frames/12-notifications.html
- type: benefit_highlight
- persuasion: Friction reduction
- beat: ease + inevitability
- ground: navy
- asset_candidates: assets/logo-without-name.svg — Lessley mark on the toast
- handoff_out: the device — x 540, y 1000, scale 1.0, opacity 1, holding still for the CTA wipe

- blueprint: agent-progress-theater (Adapt)
- focal: assets/logo-without-name.svg
- roles: logo-without-name.svg = supporting (the mark on the live toast)
- sfx: notification, pop

Adapt: keep the *machine finishes working and the receipt arrives* signature, compressed to its
second half — the working state already happened, off-screen and unattended, which is precisely
the claim. So the frame opens on the arrival.
Scene 1 (0.0–1.0s): the **circle wipe** returns navy. The device is back at rest, screen dim,
nothing happening — one beat of genuine stillness so the interruption reads as an interruption.
Scene 2 (1.0–2.2s): the toast **drops in from the top edge** and settles on a long tail
(`spring-pop-entrance`), overlapping the device: Lessley mark, `הניתוח מוכן`, timestamp. It is
the only lit thing in frame.
Scene 3 (2.2–3.6s): four badges cascade in behind it right→left, one per half-bar
(`dynamic-content-sequencing`): `ניתוח` · `מועדונים` · `דיל` · `מערכת`, each a filled pill.
Scene 4 (3.6–5.0s): `מגיע אליכם לבד.` reveals per-word across the upper third with the
**marker sweep** under `לבד` (`css-marker-patterns`), then `בלי לרענן. בלי לחפש.` in
`ground-dark-muted` beneath. Held.

`onscreen:`
1. `הניתוח מוכן` — the real notification title, arriving as a live toast.
2. Badges stack behind it: `ניתוח` · `מועדונים` · `דיל` · `מערכת`.
3. `בלי לרענן. בלי לחפש.` — the swipe hits `לבד` in `מגיע אליכם לבד.`

narrativeRole: Closes the cascade on autonomy — the product works while you don't. It is
also the last capability that only the two foundations make possible.
keyMessage: You don't go looking. It finds you.

## Selected blueprint: agent-progress-theater

# agent-progress-theater — Agent Progress Theater

**intent**: Agent work performed as WORKING-STATE theater — a short trigger beat hands the frame to the machine, which then visibly _works_: loaders spin, status phrases swap, dots pulse, counters tick — before the receipt arrives as a card whose rows cascade in and CHANGE STATE (badges flip to checks, labels strike through, severity pills read out), or as a conversation thread building message-by-message onto a camera push-in payoff. The subject is the machine performing labor over time. It is NOT a typed prompt awaiting output (no prompt/input is ever typed — the trigger is a click, a menu choice, or an already-running scan); NOT `cursor-ui-demo` (at most ONE igniting click here, then the cursor exits and the UI performs itself); NOT `grid-card-assemble` (rows there assemble into a static enumeration and hold — rows here are alive: they arrive as agent output and then MUTATE, checking off one by one while the viewer watches).

**roles served**

- Key_Feature (from `agent-progress-theater`): when the feature is the agent doing multi-step work (build a plan / scan a repo / fix a vulnerability / handle infra for you) and the proof is status theater — a loader lockup with a typed label, status couplets swapping under an `[accent]` spinner, then a checklist/findings card that populates and checks off in front of the viewer.
- Key_Feature (from `message-thread-payoff`): when the agent's work lives inside a conversation or automation thread — user/agent bubbles and tool-call/reply cards popping in sequence, the working state carried by pulsing loading dots or rapidly ticking diff counters, resolved by ONE camera push-in tight on the confirmation line (`[reaction pill]`, "Sent using `[@Bot]`", a thank-you bubble).

**duration**: 4.2–11.6s (short members are a single card-and-check-off or thread beat at ~4–5s; long members chain trigger → interstitial → status swaps → receipt card at ~9–12s; thread payoff spans 4.2–9.1s)

**shot structure** (a warm flat canvas — `[off-white / warm beige / near-white bg]`, optional `[faint grid / dot-grid / wavy-line]` texture; white rounded cards with soft drop shadows; ONE `[working accent]` color reserved for the machine (spinner, status words, active step) and one `[done color]` for completion (checks, "Completed"); camera static or ONE slow move — motion is overwhelmingly element-level springs, staggers, and state flips. Two folded sub-shapes — **(A) checklist/findings theater** and **(B) message-thread payoff**.)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~1.5s) — the trigger.** Something asks the machine to work, in ONE beat:
  - _Variant — option menu (A)_: a centered white pill card poses `[the question]`; it SPRINGS open downward into a rounded menu — `[3–4 option rows]` fade/slide in staggered, each with a number badge. A cursor enters, hover-dances between rows (a pale `[hover fill]` highlight follows it), and CLICKS the chosen row (~press-down spring); the whole menu scales down toward its center and fades out. This is the only cursor appearance in the shot.
  - _Variant — modal click (A)_: close-up of a white modal with `[Dismiss]` / `[action button]`; a hand cursor clicks the action (quick press-down spring); the modal fades away. Optionally followed by a serif `[interstitial line]` on the bare canvas — words land staggered, hold, fade out word-staggered as the bg swaps.
  - _Variant — already working (A)_: a `[Scan in progress]`-style state — a thin `[accent]` arc spinner rotating over a heading + body copy + a `[Starting…]` pill (cursor resting on it, motionless); only the spinner moves. The whole scene then rapidly scales up and fades — a push-through exit.
  - _Variant — workspace push-through (A)_: a rapid camera push-in THROUGH a multi-panel `[workspace: builder / editor / terminal]` — panels scale past the viewport edges and clear away to the bare canvas.
  - _Variant — thread opener (B)_: a `[user bubble]` spring-pops in ("`[the ask]`"), OR a stats card pops in whose green/red `[diff counters]` rapidly tick and settle — the automation's opening receipt.

- **Scene 2 (~1–4s) — the working state (the machine performs).** The frame belongs to the machine; nothing is clickable. Pick 1–3 working motifs and CHAIN them:
  - A loader lockup: a spinning `[accent asterisk / arc]` beside a `[working label]` typed on rapidly ("`Buildi` → `Building plan…`"), a left→right shimmer sweep passing through the letters; the spinner may momentarily morph asterisk↔dot and back.
  - Status couplets: 2–3 centered pairs — a dark `[action line]` over an `[accent status word]` ("Thinking…", "Noodling…") with its spinner — swapping via quick fades/slides at a steady cadence.
  - A `[scan/tool label]` types/expands rightward to its full string, then SHRINKS and DOCKS to the top-left as a fixed corner header (the canvas now belongs to what it produces).
  - A status heading flips tense as rows land beneath it ("Using `[Tool]`" → "Used `[Tool]`"), with a gently pulsing "Thinking" and gray meta-lines ("Exploring `[N]` files…") fading in below.
  - _Variant — thread machinery (B)_: the `[agent reply]` fades/slides up, then a monospace `[tool_call]` line appears beneath it — small icon + `[tool name]` + three pulsing loading dots; OR an instruction bubble scrolls into view (internal window scroll, frame static) followed by a `[brand logo]` pop-in beside a "Sending message…" row. **The pulse dies the instant the result lands** — dots vanish as the payload arrives.

- **Scene 3 (~2–4s) — the receipt cascades in (the payoff engine).** The work materializes as a card that BUILDS:
  - _Variant — checklist (A)_: a white `[Progress / summary]` pill or card SPRING-pops in with a bounce, then springs open downward (or the summary card glides UP as a taller `[findings]` panel expands beneath it). Rows cascade in one by one — slide-up + fade, staggered — each with `[number badge / severity pill]` + `[label]` + optional gray `[meta line]`. Then the STATE MUTATION runs: badges flip one by one from numbered outline to a solid `[done color]` circle + white checkmark (slight scale bounce), the checked label simultaneously strikes through and dims; pending items keep partially-drawn arc outlines animating. End the run mid-list — some items checked, some still numbered — the work is visibly _ongoing_.
  - _Variant — thread payload (B)_: the camera pushes in / pans down centering the `[tool_call]` line as a white payload card expands downward from it — 2–4 light monospace `[key: value]` lines fading in. Then the `[resolution message]` expands into place below (inline `[code chips]` and `[link]` coloring), OR a dark `[thread card]` scales up from a status row to DOMINATE the frame while the background darkens, its `[reply]` expanding into place under a "1 reply" divider.

- **Scene 4 (final ~1–2.5s) — resolve.** Two endings:
  - _Variant — hold / scroll (A)_: the finished (or mid-mutation) card stack holds static to the end, OR the viewport scrolls down the final card (fast in the last beat) revealing `[a second heading + numbered list]`, ending mid-list. A slow continuous zoom into the card may run underneath (the header drifts off the top of frame).
  - _Variant — payoff push-in (B)_: ONE camera push-in + pan-down lands tight on the payoff line — "`Sent using [@Bot]`" / the confirmation + `[thank-you bubble]` spring-in — then a `[reaction button]` springs into an active pill with bouncy overshoot and a count. The push eases into a gentle near-imperceptible drift and the clip ends on the close-up. No end card.

**motion vocabulary**: pill springs open downward into a menu/checklist · option rows fade/slide in staggered · cursor hover-dance (pale highlight fill follows the cursor between rows) · single igniting click with press-down spring · menu scale-down fade exit · modal fade-away · thin `[accent]` arc spinner rotation · spinning asterisk loader · asterisk↔dot morph · typed-on loader label with caret · left→right text shimmer sweep · serif interstitial with word-staggered fade in/out · status couplets swapping via quick fades/slides under an `[accent]` spinner · pulsing "Thinking" label · status heading tense flip (Using→Used) · label types/expands rightward then shrinks and docks as a corner header · scene scale-up/fade push-through exit · rapid camera push-in through a multi-panel workspace · slow continuous zoom into a card (header drifts off frame) · summary card spring pop with bounce · card glides up as a panel expands beneath it · anchored downward panel/payload expansion · rows stagger in (slide-up + fade) · badge flip from numbered outline to solid circle + white checkmark with scale bounce · strikethrough + dim on completion · partially-drawn arc outlines animating on pending items · severity-pill readouts (Critical / High) · viewport scroll down the final card · chat bubble spring scale-up pop-in · reply fade/slide-up · monospace tool-call line with three pulsing loading dots (dots die the instant the result lands) · payload card expands downward from the line · green/red diff counters rapid tick-and-settle · internal window scroll (frame static) · brand logo pop-in beside a status row · card scales up from a row to dominate the frame while the background darkens · reply message expands into place · inline code chips / link coloring · reaction button springs into an active pill with bouncy overshoot + count · camera push-in + pan-down centering the payoff · slight pull-back · gentle end drift · static hold.

**rule mapping**

- pill springs open downward into a menu / panel expands beneath a gliding card / payload card expands downward from a tool-call line → `anchored-layout-expand` (edge-anchored container growth: height-masked wrapper + inner counter-translate, container drawn at final size); spring flavor from `spring-pop-entrance`
- option rows / findings rows / task rows stagger in (slide-up + fade) → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered-group form, ≤500ms cap) or `gsap-effects` (plain fade+translate stagger) — NOT `waterfall-entry` (its binary no-fade arrival law contradicts this dialect's soft fade/slide cascade)
- cursor glides to a row and clicks; hand cursor clicks the modal button → `cursor-click-ripple` (move + press) + `press-release-spring` (the button's press-down spring)
- pale hover-highlight fill following the cursor between rows → `gsap-effects` (a background fill translated row-to-row; no dedicated rule needed)
- menu scale-down fade exit / scene scale-up push-through exit / palette-for-window swap → `scale-swap-transition`
- thin arc spinner rotation / spinning asterisk loader → `svg-icon-enrichment` (rotating internal SVG parts via `setAttribute('transform','rotate(deg cx cy)')`; timeline-driven, finite)
- asterisk↔dot morph and back → `scale-swap-transition` (two elements morphing at the same center)
- typed-on loader label ("Building plan…") / scan label typing to its full string → `discrete-text-sequence` (+ `context-sensitive-cursor` for the caret)
- left→right shimmer sweep through the loader letters → `ambient-glow-bloom` (single-pass traveling sheen) or `css-marker-patterns` (highlight sweep) — pick sheen for light-on-text, marker for a drawn band
- serif interstitial word-staggered fade in/out; status couplets swapping on a cadence → `dynamic-content-sequencing` (phrase windows) + `discrete-text-sequence` (the whole-state swaps); per-word stagger via `gsap-effects`
- pulsing "Thinking" label / three pulsing loading dots (phase-offset) → `sine-wave-loop` (finite repeats; kill the tween at the resolve beat — see doctrine note)
- status heading tense flip (Using→Used) / gray meta-lines fading in / final-token snaps → `discrete-text-sequence`
- label shrinks and docks to the top-left as a fixed corner header → `gsap-effects` (plain scale + translate tween; no dedicated rule needed)
- rapid camera push-in through the multi-panel workspace → `viewport-change` (the push) + `multi-phase-camera` (phasing) + optional `motion-blur-streak` (velocity blur as panels clear the frame)
- slow continuous zoom into the receipt card (header drifts off top) → `multi-phase-camera` (steady-push phase) or `viewport-change`
- summary card / progress pill / chat bubble / brand logo / file chip spring pop-in → `spring-pop-entrance`
- summary card glides up as the findings panel expands beneath → `gsap-effects` (the glide) + `anchored-layout-expand` (the panel)
- badge flip: numbered outline → solid circle + white checkmark with scale bounce → `scale-swap-transition` (outline↔solid swap at same center) + `svg-path-draw` (checkmark draw-in) + `spring-pop-entrance` (the bounce); the pending→active→complete progression itself → `dynamic-content-sequencing` (a snap state machine, per cursor-ui-demo's workflow-approve-press precedent)
- strikethrough + dim on the checked label → `css-marker-patterns` (strike-through draw) + `gsap-effects` (opacity dim)
- partially-drawn arc outlines animating on pending items → `svg-path-draw` (partial dashoffset, held mid-draw)
- viewport scroll down the final card / internal window scroll under a static frame → `gsap-effects` (transform-only content translate inside a masked window) — use `viewport-change` only if the FRAME moves
- green/red diff counters rapid tick-and-settle → `counting-dynamic-scale` (numeric proxy count-up; suppress the scale-growth component — these tick at fixed size)
- dark thread card scales up from a row to dominate the frame → `card-morph-anchor` (row → full-frame morph + handoff) with the background darkening as a `gsap-effects` overlay fade
- reply message / resolution line expands into place → `spring-pop-entrance` (soft overshoot) or `anchored-layout-expand` for a true downward growth
- reaction button springs into an active pill with overshoot + count → `spring-pop-entrance` (the pop) + `press-release-spring` (activation flavor) + `counting-dynamic-scale` (the count, if it ticks)
- camera push-in + pan-down centering the tool call / the payoff line → `coordinate-target-zoom` (non-centered target: scale + counter-translate) or `viewport-change`
- slight pull-back then gentle end drift → `multi-phase-camera` (pull-back phase + continuous micro-drift; keep the drift near-imperceptible)
- static hold on the final stack → no rule needed

**camera modifier** (default is a STATIC frame — the theater is element-level; at most ONE real move per shot, chosen from):

- Trigger push-through: a rapid push-in through the opening workspace that clears to the bare canvas → `viewport-change` + `multi-phase-camera`, optional `motion-blur-streak`.
- Receipt zoom: one slow continuous zoom into the checklist card across the whole mutation run, letting the header drift off the top → `multi-phase-camera` (steady push).
- Payoff push-in (sub-shape B's defining move): static through the build, then ONE push-in + pan-down tightening onto the confirmation line, easing to a micro-drift end → `coordinate-target-zoom` / `viewport-change` + `multi-phase-camera` (drift).
- Everything else — swaps, cascades, check-offs, scrolls — happens on a locked frame (any "scroll" is the content translating inside its window, not the camera).

**doctrine note (idle-motion ban)**: the working-state motifs (spinner rotation, pulsing dots, pulsing "Thinking") brush against motion-doctrine's idle-motion ban — here they are DIEGETIC: the pulse _performs_ "the machine is working" and is the narrative content of Scene 2, not decorative breathing. Keep every loop finite, timeline-driven, and seek-safe (`sine-wave-loop` finite repeats, `svg-icon-enrichment` rotation), and kill it at the exact frame the state resolves — the corpus does this explicitly (the loading dots vanish the instant the payload card expands; the spinner swaps out with the loader lockup).

## Selected motion rule: css-marker-patterns

# CSS Patterns for Marker Highlighting

Pure CSS + GSAP implementations of all five MarkerHighlight.js drawing modes — no external library dependency, full timeline control. Snippets show mechanism DOM only, inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core); assume `tl` exists.

Shared scaffold for every mode: the wrap is `position: relative; display: inline`; the text copy is `position: relative` and z-indexed **above** the accent (below it for sketchout, where the lines cross the text).

## 1. Highlight Mode

Yellow marker sweep behind text — the most common mode.

```html
<span class="mh-highlight-wrap">
  <span class="mh-highlight-bar" id="hl-1"></span>
  <span class="mh-highlight-text">highlighted text</span>
</span>
```

```css
.mh-highlight-bar {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0 -6px; /* bleed past the text edges */
  background: #fdd835;
  opacity: 0.35;
  transform: scaleX(0);
  transform-origin: left center;
  border-radius: 3px;
  z-index: 0;
}
```

```js
tl.to("#hl-1", { scaleX: 1, duration: 0.5, ease: "power2.out" }, 0.6);
// Optional hand-drawn skew: gsap.set("#hl-1", { skewX: -2 });
// Multi-line: tl.to(".mh-highlight-bar", { scaleX: 1, ..., stagger: 0.3 }, 0.6);
```

## 2. Circle Mode

Hand-drawn ellipse around text — `border-radius: 50%` plus a slight rotation for organic feel.

```html
<span class="mh-circle-wrap">
  <span class="mh-circle-text">IMPORTANT</span>
  <span class="mh-circle-ring" id="circle-1"></span>
</span>
```

```css
.mh-circle-ring {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  width: 130%; /* tight (short words): 150%; rounded-rect: 120% + border-radius: 30% */
  height: 160%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%) rotate(-3deg) scale(0);
  border: 3px solid #e53935;
  border-radius: 50%;
  z-index: 0;
}
```

```js
tl.to("#circle-1", { scale: 1, rotation: -3, duration: 0.6, ease: "back.out(1.7)" }, 0.7);
```

## 3. Burst Mode

Radiating lines from text center — each line a positioned span rotated to its angle. Use ~12 lines at 30° steps and **vary `--len` (40–80px)**; equal lengths look mechanical.

```html
<span class="mh-burst-wrap">
  <span class="mh-burst-text">WOW</span>
  <span class="mh-burst-container" id="burst-1">
    <span class="mh-burst-line" style="--angle: 0deg; --len: 70px;"></span>
    <span class="mh-burst-line" style="--angle: 30deg; --len: 55px;"></span>
    <!-- …one line per 30° step through 330deg, --len varied 40-80px -->
  </span>
</span>
```

```css
.mh-burst-container {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  width: 0;
  height: 0;
  z-index: 1; /* text copy at z-index: 2 */
}
.mh-burst-line {
  position: absolute;
  display: block;
  width: 3px;
  height: var(--len);
  background: #1e88e5;
  left: -1.5px;
  top: calc(-1 * var(--len));
  transform: rotate(var(--angle));
  transform-origin: bottom center;
  opacity: 0;
}
```

```js
tl.fromTo(
  "#burst-1 .mh-burst-line",
  { scaleY: 0, opacity: 0 },
  { scaleY: 1, opacity: 1, duration: 0.4, ease: "power2.out", stagger: 0.03 },
  0.7,
);
```

## 4. Scribble Mode

Wavy SVG underline that draws itself via `stroke-dashoffset`.

```html
<span class="mh-scribble-wrap">
  <span class="mh-scribble-text">underlined text</span>
  <svg class="mh-scribble-svg" viewBox="0 0 500 24" preserveAspectRatio="none">
    <path
      id="scribble-1"
      d="M0,12 Q31,0 62,12 Q93,24 125,12 Q156,0 187,12 Q218,24 250,12 Q281,0 312,12 Q343,24 375,12 Q406,0 437,12 Q468,24 500,12"
      fill="none"
      stroke="#FDD835"
      stroke-width="3"
      stroke-linecap="round"
    />
  </svg>
</span>
```

```css
.mh-scribble-svg {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  bottom: -6px; /* strikethrough variant: top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%) */
  width: 100%;
  height: 24px;
  z-index: 0;
}
```

```js
const path = document.querySelector("#scribble-1");
const len = path.getTotalLength();
gsap.set(path, { strokeDasharray: len, strokeDashoffset: len });
tl.to("#scribble-1", { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: 0.8, ease: "power1.inOut" }, 0.7);
```

Path tuning: the `Q` control points alternate y between 0 and 24 for a natural wobble. Tighter waves = smaller x-increments (~25px per half-wave); looser = ~50px; subtler amplitude = y range 0–16.

## 5. Sketchout Mode

Cross-hatch over de-emphasized text — two angled lines create a "crossed out" effect.

```html
<span class="mh-sketchout-wrap">
  <span class="mh-sketchout-text">old price</span>
  <span class="mh-sketchout-lines" id="sketchout-1">
    <span class="mh-sketchout-line mh-sketchout-fwd"></span>
    <span class="mh-sketchout-line mh-sketchout-bwd"></span>
  </span>
</span>
```

```css
.mh-sketchout-lines {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0 -4px;
  overflow: hidden;
  z-index: 1; /* text at z-index: 0 — the lines cross OVER it */
}
.mh-sketchout-line {
  position: absolute;
  display: block;
  top: 50%;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 2px;
  background: #e53935;
  transform-origin: left center;
}
.mh-sketchout-fwd {
  transform: scaleX(0) rotate(-12deg);
}
.mh-sketchout-bwd {
  transform: scaleX(0) rotate(12deg);
}
```

```js
// Forward slash first, backward follows
tl.to("#sketchout-1 .mh-sketchout-fwd", { scaleX: 1, duration: 0.3, ease: "power2.out" }, 1.0);
tl.to("#sketchout-1 .mh-sketchout-bwd", { scaleX: 1, duration: 0.3, ease: "power2.out" }, 1.15);
```

## Combining Modes in Captions

Cycle modes across caption groups for visual variety — every 2-3 groups for high energy, 3-4 for medium, 4-5 for low:

```js
const MODES = ["highlight", "circle", "burst", "scribble"];
GROUPS.forEach((group, gi) => {
  const mode = MODES[gi % MODES.length];
  group.emphasisWords.forEach((word) => applyMode(word.el, mode, tl, word.start));
});
```

## Selected motion rule: dynamic-content-sequencing

# Dynamic Content Sequencing

A utility pattern (not a motion rule in itself) for scenes that show a SEQUENCE of items (cards, phrases, stats): each item's duration is computed from its content length + per-item config, and the sequencer assigns absolute start/end times automatically — no hardcoded offsets per item. Distinct from [discrete-text-sequence](discrete-text-sequence.md) (one text element changing states) — this rule swaps between distinct content blocks.

## How It Works

A content array of `{ eyebrow, title, body, speedFactor, hold }` entries is reduced once at build time into a flat `TIMELINE` of `{ …entry, start, end }` — duration per entry is `BASE_DURATION + body.length × SEC_PER_CHAR + hold`, so longer text earns more reading time. A single linear driver's `onUpdate` reverse-searches the active entry and swaps the DOM **only on transitions** (a `lastTitle` guard — per-frame `textContent` writes flicker in render); an optional progress bar fills 0→100% across the whole run.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="display">
  <div class="eyebrow" id="eyebrow"></div>
  <div class="title" id="title"></div>
  <div class="body" id="body"></div>
  <div class="progress-bar"><div class="progress-fill" id="progress-fill"></div></div>
</div>
```

```css
.body {
  min-height: 160px; /* reserve space — content height varies; without this, layout jumps */
}
.progress-fill {
  height: 100%;
  width: 0%;
}
```

```js
// N entries, each with its own pacing (optionally a speedFactor multiplier);
// the final entry uses a larger hold (closing beat).
const CONTENT = [
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrow1}", title: "{title1}", body: "{body1}", hold: HOLD_MID },
  // …
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrowN}", title: "{titleN}", body: "{bodyN}", hold: HOLD_FINAL },
];

// Pre-compute absolute start/end ONCE — never in onUpdate.
let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry) => {
  const dur = BASE_DURATION + entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR + entry.hold;
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});

function entryAt(time) {
  for (let i = TIMELINE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= TIMELINE[i].start) return TIMELINE[i];
  }
  return TIMELINE[0];
}

const eyebrowEl = document.getElementById("eyebrow");
const titleEl = document.getElementById("title");
const bodyEl = document.getElementById("body");
const progressEl = document.getElementById("progress-fill");

const TOTAL_DURATION = cumulative + TAIL_PAD;
const driver = { t: 0 };
let lastTitle = "";

tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const entry = entryAt(driver.t);
      // Swap content only on transitions — no per-frame DOM thrash
      if (entry.title !== lastTitle) {
        eyebrowEl.textContent = entry.eyebrow;
        titleEl.textContent = entry.title;
        bodyEl.textContent = entry.body;
        lastTitle = entry.title;
      }
      progressEl.style.width = `${(driver.t / TOTAL_DURATION) * 100}%`;
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Crossfade between items** — return BOTH adjacent entries during an overlap window (`time ≥ e.start − overlap && time ≤ e.end + overlap`, overlap ≈ 0.3s) and render them with opacities computed from distance to the boundary.
- **Per-item motion variation** — map an `entry.style` key to an existing rule per chapter (e.g. `3d-text-depth-layers` → `hacker-flip-3d` → `counting-dynamic-scale`); the sequencer only orchestrates timing.
- **Auto-extend composition duration** — you can set `data-duration` from the computed `TOTAL_DURATION` in script, but HF reads `data-duration` at composition load and setting it after init may not take effect — author the duration manually from a rough total.

### Accelerating cadence (geometric hold decay)

For rhetorical escalation — "everyone says…", a roll-call, a praise flurry — the beat grid itself accelerates: early entries hold ~1s (read speed), then windows shrink geometrically into a ~0.15–0.3s flurry, braking on an emphasis state before the resolve. The acceleration is pre-computed into the same flat `TIMELINE` — still content-driven, still deterministic, no speed-up tween anywhere:

```js
// Geometric decay on the hold, clamped at a flurry floor; the brake state holds longest.
const HOLDS = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => Math.max(FLURRY_FLOOR, HOLD_START * Math.pow(DECAY, i)));
HOLDS[CONTENT.length - 1] = HOLD_FINAL;

let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => {
  // Past ~0.5s states are glanced as motion texture, not read —
  // drop the per-char term or you never reach flurry speed.
  const readable = HOLDS[i] >= READ_THRESHOLD;
  const dur = HOLDS[i] + (readable ? entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR : 0);
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});
```

Worked example — **praise-chip flurry**: ~16 short quotes hard-cut through a chip beside a pinned wordmark. First 3 states at `HOLD_START = 1.0` (each reads fully); `DECAY = 0.8` shrinks every following window until `FLURRY_FLOOR = 0.2` catches it (≈12 states over ~2.5s — a churn of acclaim, individually glanced); the longest phrase takes `HOLD_FINAL ≈ 1.6` as the brake before the closing lockup.

Values: `HOLD_START` 0.8–1.2s; `DECAY` 0.75–0.88 (higher = longer runway before the flurry bites); `FLURRY_FLOOR` 0.15–0.3s (below ~0.15s swaps strobe); `READ_THRESHOLD` ~0.5s; brake ≥ 4× the floor or the stop doesn't register as a beat. The 3–6 entry guidance relaxes here — 12–18 states are legal precisely because flurry states aren't individually read. The hard-cut discipline (`lastTitle` guard, instant swaps) is what lets 0.2s states render clean.

## Critical Constraints

- **Pre-compute the TIMELINE once at build** — never recompute in `onUpdate`; the reverse search over the flat array is the whole per-frame cost.
- **DOM swap only on entry transition** (`lastTitle`/key guard) — per-frame `textContent` assignment flickers in HF render.
- **`min-height` on the body element** — without reservation, downstream elements (progress bar, brand) jitter as content height varies.
- **Sequential only** — for parallel tracks use a different reduction.
- **Titles fit one line at the chosen size; bodies fit inside `min-height` after wrapping.**

# Spring-Pop Entrance

> **Smooth beats bouncy.** This entrance defaults to a smooth long-tail settle — `power3.out` (or `expo.out` for a faster front) — that decelerates cleanly into the resting size with **no overshoot**. Bouncy `back.out` is the **#1 instant turn-off** in agent-made videos and is almost never executed well; it is a rare, explicitly-playful exception (consumer / fun brand), never the default. When unsure, settle smoothly.

THE entrance primitive: an element (or staggered group) arrives by springing from nothing — `scale: 0 → 1`, optional small `y` rise — and settles without bouncing. This is **arrival**, not reaction: distinct from [press-release-spring.md](press-release-spring.md) (a click/press → release feedback chain on an element that already rests on screen). Many blueprints used to borrow that rule to fake an entrance; reach for this instead.

## How It Works

One `fromTo` carries the whole arrival: from `{ scale: 0, opacity: 0 }` (explicit, so t=0 is correct under seek) to `{ scale: 1, opacity: 1, ease: "power3.out" }`. For a **group**, the same `fromTo` runs per element at `i * STAGGER`, capped so the group reads as one arriving beat. The `scale` grow is load-bearing; the `y` rise is garnish — drop everything else and it must still read as a clean entrance. Let the ease produce the settle: never hand-key a `scale: 1.1` mid-state (it double-bounces against the curve).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="pop-hero" id="hero">{heroLabel}</div>

<div class="pop-grid">
  <div class="pop-item">{itemA}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemB}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemC}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.pop-hero,
.pop-item {
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* in-place pop; move to the source point for the anchored variation */
  will-change: transform;
}
.pop-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: GRID_GAP;
  place-items: center;
}
```

```js
// Single hero pop — smooth long-tail settle, no overshoot.
tl.fromTo(
  "#hero",
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0 },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  ENTRY_AT,
);

// Staggered group pop — one arriving beat.
gsap.utils.toArray(".pop-item").forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    { scale: 0, opacity: 0, y: Y_RISE },
    { scale: 1, opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
    GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Calm settle** (premium / enterprise): `power3.out`, no rotation, `Y_RISE` 0–12px — a weighted, confident landing for a hero wordmark or product shot.
- **Firm settle** (everyday default): `power3.out` or `expo.out` for a punchier front, `Y_RISE` ~24px — cards, icons, callouts.
- **Exact-physics settle**: when the settle IS the shot, swap the ease for `springEase({ response: 0.4 })` (critically damped) from `../adapters/gsap-easing-and-stagger.md` → Spring Eases; take `duration` from the helper.
- **Origin-anchored pop**: a callout growing out of a specific point (marker, pointer tip) sets `transform-origin` to that point (e.g. `0% 100%`) so `scale: 0 → 1` reads as "emerging from the source", not "inflating in place".
- **Pop into a held slot**: land the pop and hold still — no idle loop baked into the entrance. If the held frame genuinely needs life, hand off to [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) for subtle jitter on a separate later tween; prefer revealing the next element on its VO cue.
- **Bouncy pop (RARE — explicitly-playful only)**: swap the ease for `back.out(OVERSHOOT)` and optionally settle a small `rotation: ROT_FROM → 0` so elements look hand-placed. Only for a deliberately playful register — never product / enterprise / serious tone:

```js
tl.fromTo(
  el,
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0, rotation: ROT_FROM },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, rotation: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: `back.out(${OVERSHOOT})` },
  GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
);
```

Even here keep `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2` — past that it reads as cartoon wobble. Better still: the baked spring at `dampingFraction: 0.6–0.7` (same adapters doc) gives ~5–10% overshoot that reads physical where `back.out` reads cartoon.

| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EASE       | `power3.out` default; `expo.out` punchier | `back.out(OVERSHOOT)` only in the playful variant                |
| POP_DUR    | 0.4–0.7s                                  | shorter = tight snap; hero must be visible by **t ≤ 0.5s**       |
| STAGGER    | 0.04–0.08s                                | `min(0.06, 0.5 / ITEM_COUNT)` — self-caps the window             |
| ITEM_COUNT | 3–9                                       | >9 makes the stagger vanish — switch to a wipe/sweep reveal      |
| Y_RISE     | 0–32px                                    | small; never large enough to read as a slide-up                  |
| ROT_FROM   | −10°–+10°                                 | playful variant only; alternate sign by index (`i % 2 ? 6 : -6`) |
| ENTRY_AT   | 0–0.4s                                    | a beat of quiet, but keep the subject landing by t ≤ 0.5s        |

## Critical Constraints

- Default ease `power3.out` (no overshoot); `back.out` only in the explicitly-playful variant, and there `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2`.
- `ITEM_COUNT × STAGGER ≤ ~0.5s` — the group must land inside one beat.
- Entrances state the collapsed from-state in `fromTo` — never rely on a CSS-hidden start (it renders visible before the tween claims it under seek).
- `transform-origin: 50% 50%` for an in-place pop; the source point only for the anchored variation.
- This is a finite arrival — idle motion on a held element is a separate, later `sine-wave-loop` tween.
